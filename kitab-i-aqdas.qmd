In the name of the one who governs what was and what will be

## Recognize His Revelation and Follow His Command

1 Indeed, the first thing that God wrote for the servants is the recognition of His luminous revelation and the rise of His command, which was the status of His soul in the world of command and creation. Whoever wins it has won all the good. And the one who is prevented, indeed, he is among the people of misguidance, even if he comes with all the deeds. If you have won this highest status and the highest horizon, it is appropriate for every soul to follow what was ordered from the intended one, for both together do not accept one without the other. This is what was ruled by the rise of inspiration.

2 Indeed, those who were given insights by God, they see God's limits, the greatest reason for the order of the world and the preservation of nations. And the one who was negligent, indeed, he is among the savages. We have commanded you to break the boundaries of self and desire, not what was numbered by the highest pen. It is the spirit of life for whoever is possible. The oceans of wisdom and expression have roared with what the breath of mercy has stirred. Seize it, O people of understanding. Those who have broken God's covenant in his commands and turned back on their heels, those are among the people of misguidance in the presence of the rich, the exalted.

3 O people of the Earth, know that my orders are the lamp of my care among my servants and the keys of my mercy for my creatures. Thus, the order was revealed from the sky of the will of your Lord, the owner of religions. If someone finds the sweetness of the explanation that appeared from the mouth of the will of the merciful, he would spend what he has, even if it were all the treasures of the Earth, to establish an order from his shining orders from the horizon of care and kindness.

4 Say, whoever passes by my boundaries recognizes my shirt and with it the banners of victory are raised over the canons and submission. My power's tongue has spoken in the greatness of my majesty, addressing my creatures, that they should love my boundaries for my beauty. Blessed is the lover who recognized the beloved from this word that exudes the breezes of grace, which cannot be described by remembrances. By my life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of kindness, he orbits around my radiant orders from the horizon of creativity.

5 Do not think that we have revealed to you only the judgments. Rather, we have opened the seal of the sealed nectar with the fingers of power and capability. This is attested by what was revealed from the pen of revelation. Reflect on this, O people of thoughts.

## Prayer and Fasting

6 Prayer has been prescribed for you, nine prostrations for Allah, the revealer of the verses, at noon, and in the early morning and evening. And we have forgiven another number, an order in the Book of Allah, it is indeed the capable, the chosen command. And when you want to pray, turn your faces towards the most holy, the sacred place, which God has made the circuit of the highest assembly and the face of the people of the cities of eternity, and the source of the command for those in the two earths and the heavens. And at the sunset of the truth and clarification, the place which we have determined for you, it is indeed the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

7 Everything has been fulfilled by His decree when the sun of the judgments rises from the horizon of the statement, it is upon everyone to follow it, even if by order, the skies of the hearts of religions would burst open from it. Indeed, He does what He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. And what the beloved has ruled is indeed beloved and the owner of invention. The one who found has recognized the Merciful and recognized the rise of this statement, indeed, he would receive arrows in his eyes to establish the judgments among people. Blessed is the one who accepted and won by the separation of the speech.

8 We have detailed the prayer in another document. Blessed is the one who acts according to what was ordered from the owner of the necks. Six takbirs have been revealed in the prayer for the dead, from Allah, the revealer of the verses, and the one who has the knowledge of reading, he should read what was revealed before them, otherwise, God has forgiven him, indeed, He is the Mighty, the Forgiver.

9 Hair does not invalidate your prayer, nor what is prevented from the spirit such as bones and the like. Wear fur as you wear silk and squirrel, and what is less than them, it was not forbidden in the Quran, but it has been confused for the scholars. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

10 Prayer and fasting have been ordained for you from the onset of puberty, a command from your Lord and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Whoever has weakness in him due to illness or old age, God has forgiven him, a favor from Him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God has permitted you to prostrate on anything pure, and we have lifted from it the judgment of the limit in the book. Indeed, God knows and you do not know. Whoever does not find water, he mentions five times "in the name of Allah, the purest, the purest", then he commences the work. This is what the Lord of the worlds and the countries where the nights and the days are long have ruled. So let them pray by the hours and the aspects from which the times have been determined. Indeed, He is the Clear, the Wise.

11 We have pardoned you for the prayer of the verses when they appear, remember Allah with greatness and power. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing. Say, the greatness is for Allah, Lord of what is seen and what is not seen, Lord of the worlds.

12 The prayer has been ordained for you individually, the judgment of congregation has been lifted except in the funeral prayer. Indeed, He is the Wise in command.

13 Allah has pardoned women when they find blood from fasting and prayer, and they should perform ablution and glorify Him ninety-five times from noon to noon, "glorified is Allah of the rising and the beauty." This is what has been ordained in the book if you are among the knowledgeable.

14 And for you and for them in journeys, when you settle and find a secure place, let each prayer be a single prostration and remember in it, "Glory be to Allah, the possessor of greatness, majesty, endowment, and favors". And whoever is unable to say "Glory be to Allah", it is sufficient for him with the truth. Indeed, He is the sufficient, the everlasting, the forgiving, the merciful.

After completing the prostration, you and they should sit on the structure of monotheism and say eighteen times, "Glory be to Allah, the possessor of sovereignty and the kingdom." Thus does Allah clarify the paths of truth and guidance, and indeed, they lead to one way, which is this straight path. Thank Allah for this great favor. Praise Allah for this endowment that encompasses the heavens and the earth. Remember Allah for this mercy that has preceded the worlds.

15 Say, "Indeed, Allah has made the key to the hidden treasure my love. If you knew, without the key, it would remain concealed in the eternity of pre-existence, if you truly knew. Say, this is the source of revelation and the dawn of illumination, by which all horizons are lit, if you truly understood. Indeed, this is the confirmed decree, and by it every predetermined decree is established."

16 O Supreme Pen, say, "O people! We have prescribed fasting for you for a fixed number of days and have made the New Year a celebration for you after its completion. Thus, the sun of clarification has risen from the book's horizon by the command of the Originator and the Returner.

Make the additional days before the month of fasting, which we have made manifestations of the letter "Ha" among the nights and days. When defined by the borders of the year and the months, the people of glory should feed themselves, their relatives, then the poor and the needy, and they should celebrate, glorify, praise, and magnify their Lord in joy and happiness.

When the days of giving before restraint have been completed, they should enter into fasting. This is the decree of the Lord of the people. There is no hardship upon the traveler, the sick, the pregnant, and the nursing. Allah has excused them as a favor from Him, for He is the Mighty, the Bestower."

17 These are the limits of Allah, which are inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the parchment and the tablets. Hold firmly to the commands and judgments of Allah, and do not be among those who take the roots of their selves and discard the roots of Allah behind their backs because they have followed their suspicions and illusions.

Refrain yourselves from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. Beware that your desires do not prevent you from this bounty, which has been determined in the book.

### Ablutions

18 It has been decreed for those who believe in Allah, the Judge, to wash their hands and then their faces every day. Then they should sit facing Allah and recite ninety-five times, "Allah is the most glorious." This is the command of the Creator of the sky, Who has established Himself on the throne of names with majesty and power. Thus, you should perform ablution for the prayer, a command from Allah, the One, the Chosen.

## Actions Towards Others

### Harming Others

19 You have been forbidden to kill, commit adultery, backbite, and slander. Avoid what you have been prohibited from in the scriptures and tablets.

### Inheritance

20 We have divided the inheritance according to the number of the letter ز (Za). This was decreed for your offspring in the book of ط (Ta) according to the number of مقت (displeasure). For the spouses, it was decided in the book of ح (Ha) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ف (Fa). For the fathers, it was written in the book of ز (Za) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ك (Kaf).

For the mothers, it was determined in the book of و (Waw) according to the number of رفيع (exalted). For the brothers, it was mentioned in the book of ه (Ha) the number of ش (Shin). For the sisters, it was stated in the book of د (Dal) the number of ر (Ra) and م (Meem). For the teachers, it was noted in the book of ج (Jeem) the number of ق (Qaf) and ف (Fa).

This is how it was judged by the heralds who mention Me in the nights and at dawn. When we heard the noise of the offspring in the loins, we doubled what was for them and reduced from the other. He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, and He does with His authority as He pleases.

21 If someone passes away and has no offspring, their rights revert back to the House of Justice so that the trustees of the Merciful may distribute it among orphans, widows, and what benefits the majority of the people, so they may give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving.

22 And for the one who has offspring but does not have what was specified in the scripture, two-thirds of what he left go to his offspring and one-third goes to the House of Justice. Thus is the decree of the Mighty, the Supreme in dignity and grandeur.

23 And for the one who has no inheritors but has close relatives from the children of his brother, sister, and their daughters, they receive two-thirds. If not, it goes to the paternal uncles, aunts, maternal uncles, aunts, and those after them, to their sons and daughters. The remaining one-third goes back to the House of Justice. This is a decree in the scripture from Allah, the owner of all souls.

24 Whoever dies without any of the designated inheritors as per the divine decree from the Most High Pen, all of their wealth is returned to the aforementioned House of Justice, to be distributed as per God's command. Indeed, He is the All-Powerful, the Commander.

25 We have designated the inhabited dwelling and the specific clothing for the male descendants, not the females, and the inheritors. Indeed, He is the Bestower, the Overflowing.

26 Indeed, those who die during their father's lifetime and have descendants, they will inherit what belongs to their father as written in the Book of Allah. Distribute among them with pure justice. Thus, the sea of speech has surged and cast forth the pearls of judgments from the Sovereign of all beings.

27 And for those who leave behind weak descendants, hand over their inheritance to a trustworthy guardian who will invest it for them until they reach maturity or the stipulated partnership age. Then, assign the guardian a right from what has been gained from the trade and business.

28 All of this is to be done after the payment of Allah's right, if there are any debts on the deceased, and the preparation of means for shrouding and burial, and carrying the deceased with dignity and honor. Thus, is the decree of the Master of the Beginning and the End.

29 Say: This is the hidden knowledge that will not change, for it began with the 'Ta' symbolizing the stored name, the Manifest, the Forbidden, the Impenetrable. And what we have designated for the offspring is from Allah's favor upon them, so they may thank their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. These are the limits set by Allah, do not transgress them by your own desires. Follow what you have been commanded from the source of the statement, and the sincere ones see the boundaries of Allah as the water of life for the people of religions, and the lamp of wisdom and success for those on the earth and in the heavens.

### The House of Justice

30 Allah has decreed for every city to establish a House of Justice where souls gather in number equal to 'Bahá' (9), and if it increases, there is no harm. They should feel as though they are entering the presence of Allah, the Most High, the Supreme, seeing Him who is unseen. They should act as trustees of the Merciful among possibilities and as deputies of Allah for all who are on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants for the sake of Allah, just as they consult on their own affairs, and choose what is most select. Such is the decree of your Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving. Beware of neglecting what is specified in the Tablet. Fear Allah, O people of insight.

### Houses In The Name of the Lord

31 O concourse of creation, build houses as perfectly as possible in all places in the name of the Lord of all religions in the lands, and adorn them as befits them, not with images and likenesses. Then remember your Lord, the Merciful, in them with spirit and fragrance. It is through His remembrance that hearts are illuminated and eyes are pleased.

### Pilgrimage

32 God has ordained for those among you who are capable to perform the pilgrimage to the House, except for women, from whom He has excused, as a mercy from Him. Indeed, He is the Giver, the Bestower.

### Engage In An Occupation

33 O people of Baha, it is obligatory for each of you to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, farming, and the like. We have regarded your engagement in these as equivalent to worship for God, the Truth. Reflect, O people, on the mercy of God and His grace, then thank Him at dawn and dusk.

Do not waste your time in idleness and laziness, but engage in that which benefits yourselves and others. Thus has the matter been decreed in this Tablet, from whose horizon has shone the sun of wisdom and explanation. The most despised of people before God are those who sit idle and beg. Grasp the rope of means, relying on God, the Cause of causes.

### Repent to God Only

34 It has been forbidden for you in this Book to kiss hands. This is what you have been prohibited from by your Lord, the Mighty, the Judge. No one should seek forgiveness from another. Repent to God sincerely. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Giver, the Mighty, the Relenting.

### Stand Up In Service of the Command

35 O servants of the Merciful, stand up in service of the command, no matter the situation, lest grief from those who disbelieve in the appearance of the signs overtake you. When the promise came and what was promised became apparent, people disagreed and each party clung to what they had of conjectures and illusions.

### Do Not Deprive Yourself of What God Allows

36 Among people, there are those who humble themselves like the straps of sandals, seeking the chest of glory. Say, "Who are you, O negligent and deceitful one?" And among them are those who claim to comprehend the innermost and the innermost of the innermost. Say, "O liar, by God, you have nothing. Indeed, it is the outer layers that we have left for you, just as bones are left for dogs. By God, the truth is, if one were to wash the feet of the world and worship God in the thickets, the wilderness, the mountains, the valleys, and the hilltops, and at every stone, tree, meadow, and never deviates from it, my approval would never be accepted." This is what the Lord of all beings has decreed.

How many a servant has secluded himself in the islands of India, depriving himself of what God has permitted him, enduring hardships and tribulations, yet does not mention before God the station of the signs. Do not make your actions a partnership of hopes, and do not deprive yourselves of this goal, which was the hope of the near ones in the primordial past. Say, "The spirit of actions is my satisfaction, and everything is contingent upon my acceptance." Read the tablets so you may know what is intended in the books of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Whoever succeeds in my love, it is his right to sit on the bed of contentment in the heart of existence. As for the one who is deprived, even if he were to sit on the ground, he seeks refuge from it with God, the Lord of all religions.

### Asserting a Proclamation Before a Thousand Years

37 Whoever makes a proclamation or asserts something before the completion of a full thousand years, they are undoubtedly a liar and fabricator. We pray to God to guide them towards retraction if they express remorse. Indeed, He is the Forgiver. If they persist in their claim, a merciless punishment will befall them, for He is severe in retribution. Anyone who interprets or explains this verse in a way that deviates from its apparent meaning is deprived of God's Spirit and His mercy, which predated all worlds. Fear God and do not follow your illusions. Comply with what your Mighty and Wise Lord instructs you. The uproar will emerge from most lands. Steer clear of it, O people, and do not follow every immoral, contemptible person. This we have informed you of when we were in Iraq, in the land of secrecy, and in this radiant scene.

### Rise to the Defense of God's Cause

38 O people of the Earth, when the sun of my beauty sets and the sky of my structure is concealed, do not be disturbed. Rise to the defense of my cause and the elevation of my word among all the worlds. Indeed, we are with you in every circumstance, and we will support you with the truth. Indeed, we have been capable. Whoever recognizes me, shall serve me with a dedication that the armies of heavens and earth cannot deter.

39 Indeed, people are asleep; if they were to awaken, they would hasten with their hearts to the All-Knowing, Wise God, and discard what they have, even if it were all the treasures of the world, so that their Lord may remember them with a word from Him. This is how He informs you from Him, knowledge of the unseen in a Tablet of what has appeared in the possible and what He alone has been informed of, the One who is in charge of all the worlds.

The intoxication of desire has overtaken them so that they do not see the Master of the universe, whose call has risen from all directions, "There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise."

### Blessed Are Days In Remembrance of God

40 Say, "Do not rejoice in what you have possessed in the evening and at dawn; someone else will possess it. Thus, the All-Knowing, the Expert informs you. Say, have you seen what you have as a permanent or lasting? No, and by My Merciful Self, if you were fair, you would see your days passing like the winds and your glory folding up like that of the ancients. Contemplate, O people, where are your past days and where are your wasted times. Blessed are the days that passed in the remembrance of God, and the times that were spent in His wise remembrance.

By My Life, there will be no glory for the mighty, no adornments for the rich, no thorns for the wretched. Everything will perish by a word from Him, for He is the Capable, the Mighty, the Powerful. What people have of furnishings does not benefit them, and they have been negligent of what would benefit them. They will become aware and will not find what they have missed in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If they knew, they would spend what they have to remember their names by the Throne, but they are among the dead."

41 Among the people are those who are deceived by their knowledge, and with it, they are barred from my everlasting name. When they hear the sound of footsteps behind them, they see themselves greater than Nimrod. Say, "Where is he, O you who are rejected? By God, he is indeed in the depths of Hell.

Say, "O assembly of scholars, do you not hear the creaking of my supreme pen, and do not you see this rising sun from the most glorious horizon? Why do you stay attached to the idols of your whims? Leave your illusions and turn towards God, your ancient master."

### Endowments

42 The endowments specifically meant for good deeds have returned to God, the revealer of signs. No one has the right to dispose of them except after permission from the source of revelation, and after him, the decision reverts to the branches, and after them to the House of Justice, once its order is established in the lands, so that they may spend it in the elevated lands in this matter and in what they have been commanded by the potent, capable one.

Otherwise, they should revert to the people of Bahá, who do not speak except after his permission, and do not rule except by what God has ruled in this Tablet. These are the supporters of victory between the heavens and the earth, to spend it on what has been specified in the Book from a Mighty, Generous one.

### Seek A Course Between Two Extremes

43 Do not despair in times of adversity, nor rejoice excessively. Seek a course between the two extremes. It is to be mindful in such a state and alert to what will befall you in the end. Thus, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise informs you.

### Hair

44 Do not shave your heads, for God has adorned them with hair. Indeed, in this are signs for those who contemplate the natural order as decreed by the Creator of all creatures. He is indeed the Mighty, the Wise. Moreover, it is not appropriate to exceed the limit of the ears. This is what the Lord of the Worlds has decreed.

### Justice For the Thief

45 For the thief, the verdict has been decreed as exile and imprisonment, and for the third offense, put a mark on his forehead that he may be recognized, so that he may not be welcomed into the cities of God and His homes. Beware that you do not let mercy cloud your judgement in the law of God. Act as you have been commanded by the Compassionate, Merciful One. We have nurtured you with the whips of wisdom and judgment for your own preservation and elevation, as parents nurture their children. By My life, if you knew what we intended for you with our sacred commands, you would offer your lives for this sacred, powerful, and impregnable cause.

### Use Utensils and Be Refined

46 Whoever wishes to use utensils of gold and silver, there is no harm upon them. Beware that your hands do not delve into vulgar and cheap utensils. Opt for what is closer to refinement, as He wishes to see you uphold the manners of the inhabitants of Paradise in His invincible and impregnable kingdom.

Adhere to refinement in all circumstances, lest your eyes fall upon what you and the inhabitants of Paradise dislike. Whoever overlooks it, his work shall be nullified immediately, yet if he has an excuse, God will forgive him. Indeed, He is the Powerful, the Generous.

### God Is The Only Infallibility

47 The one who manifests the command is not to be associated with the Greater Infallibility. Indeed, he is the one who exercises his will in the realm of creation. God has exclusively destined this status for Himself, and no share of this mighty, impregnable matter has been allotted to anyone else. This is the command of God, which has been concealed behind the veils of the unseen. We have unveiled it in this manifestation, and with it, we have torn the veil of those who have not recognized the ruling of the Book and have been among the heedless.

### Fathers Must Educate His Children

48 It is ordained that every father must educate his son and daughter in knowledge and writing, as well as in other matters specified in the Tablet. If a father fails to fulfill these responsibilities, the trustees are to take from him what is necessary for their education, if he is affluent. Otherwise, the matter should be referred to the House of Justice. We have made it a refuge for the poor and needy. Indeed, whoever nurtures his child or a child from among the children, it is as if he has nurtured one of my children. Upon him is My Glory, My Care, and My Mercy, which precede all worlds.

### Fine For Adultery

49 God has decreed for every adulterer and adulteress a fine to be paid to the House of Justice, which is nine mithqals of gold. If they repeat the offense, double the penalty. This is the judgment given by the Possessor of all Names in both the former and the latter case, a humiliating punishment has been prescribed for them.

However, if anyone is afflicted with a sin, they have the opportunity to repent and return to God. Indeed, He forgives whom He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. Indeed, He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

50 Beware lest the clamor of glory prevents you from the sweetness of this humble stream. Take the cups of prosperity in this morning in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn, then drink with the remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the Inventive.

### Music

51 We have permitted for you the sounds and melodies. Beware lest the sounds divert you from the affairs of manners and dignity. Rejoice with the joy of My Greatest Name by which hearts have turned and the minds of those close have been attracted. We have made it a ladder for the souls to ascend to the highest horizon. Do not make it a wing of self and passion. I seek refuge that you become of the ignorant.

### Blood Money

52 We have returned a third of all the blood money to the seat of justice, and we counsel its men to be purely just. They should dispense what has gathered with them as they have been commanded from the all-knowing, wise. O men of justice, be the shepherds of God's flock in His kingdom and protect them from the wolves who have appeared in clothing, just as you protect your children. Thus counsels you the trustworthy adviser.

### Wisdom in Baha'u'llah's Absence

53 If you disagree about a matter, return it to God as long as the sun is rising from the horizon of this sky. And when it sets, refer to what has been revealed from Him. Indeed, it is sufficient for all the worlds.

Say, O people, do not let confusion overtake you when the kingdom of my revelation is obscured and the waves of the sea of my explanation are stilled. Indeed, there is wisdom in my appearance and another wisdom in my absence, which only God, the Singular, the Knowledgeable, knows. And we see you from my most glorious horizon, and we help those who stand to support my cause with troops from the highest assembly and hosts of the nearest angels.

### Detachment

54 O hosts of the earth, by the Truth, indeed sweet, flavorful rivers have burst forth from the rocks due to the sweetness of the discourse of your chosen Lord, and you are among the oblivious. Leave what is with you, then fly with the steps of detachment above the plane of creation. Thus, the Master of invention, who by the movement of His pen turned the worlds upside, commands you.

55 Do you know from which horizon your most Glorious Lord is calling you? Do you know from which pen your Lord, the Master of names, is commanding you? No, by My life, if you knew, you would abandon the world, turning with all your hearts toward the direction of the Beloved, and the vibration of the Word would affect you so profoundly that the greater world would shake, let alone this lesser world. Thus, the rains of My bounty have poured from the sky of My providence, a favor from Me, so that you might be among the grateful.

### Penalty For Fighting and Hitting

56 As for fighting and hitting, their rulings vary according to their severity, and the judge's ruling is for each severity a specific fine. Indeed, He is the Decisive, the Mighty, the Impenetrable. If we wish, we can detail it truthfully and according to a promise from us. Indeed, He is the Fulfilling, the Knowing.

### Extend Hospitality Monthly

57 It is decreed upon you to extend hospitality once every month, even if only with water. Indeed, God intends to bring hearts together, even through the causes of heavens and earths.

### Be Like Fingers In a Hand

58 Beware lest the affairs of the self and desires separate you. Be like the fingers in a hand and the pillars of the body. Thus does the Pen of Revelation counsel you, if indeed you are of the assured.

59 Look then upon the mercy of God and His favours. Indeed, He commands you what benefits you, even though He is independent of all the worlds. Your wrongdoings cannot harm Us, just as your good deeds cannot benefit Us. We only call you for the sake of God. Every knowledgeable and discerning one bears witness to this.

### Avoid Excess in Hunting

60 When you send your hunting animals after game, remember God at that moment. Then, what they catch for you is permissible, even if you find it already dead. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.

Avoid excess in this regard. Be on the path of justice and fairness in all matters. Thus commands you the source of all revelation, if indeed you are among those who understand.

### Show Kindness to Kin

61 Verily, God has commanded you to show kindness to your kin, and He has not ordained for them any right in people's wealth. Indeed, He is the Self-Sufficient, independent of all the worlds.

### Arson and Murder Penalties

62 Whoever intentionally burns a house, burn him, and whoever deliberately kills a person, kill him. Implement God's laws with the hands of power and authority, then abandon the ways of ignorance. And if you decide to sentence them to eternal imprisonment, there is no blame on you in the book. Indeed, He is the judge over what He wishes.
