In the name of the one who governs what was and what will be

## Recognize His Revelation and Follow His Command

1 The first thing that God has prescribed for His servants is the recognition of the dawning place of His Revelation and the source of His command, which is the station of His own Self in the realm of command and creation. Whoever attains this has attained all good, and whoever is deprived of it is indeed among the people of error, even if he performs every good deed. If you attain this exalted station and this supreme horizon, every soul must follow what has been commanded by the Desired One, for both are inseparable, one cannot be accepted without the other. This is what the Source of Inspiration has decreed.

2 Indeed, those who have been endowed with insight from God see the ordinances of God as the greatest means for the order of the world and the preservation of nations. And those who are heedless of this are like the ignorant masses. We have commanded you to break the boundaries of self and desire, not what has been decreed by the Supreme Pen. It is the spirit of life for those in existence. The seas of wisdom and eloquence have surged forth with the stirring breeze of the All-Merciful. Seize this opportunity, O possessors of intellect. Those who have violated the covenant of God concerning His commands and have turned back on their heels, they are indeed among the people of error in the sight of the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted.

3 O assembly of the earth, know that My commands are the lamps of My care among My servants and the keys of My mercy for My creation. Thus has the command been revealed from the heaven of the will of your Lord, the Lord of all religions. If anyone were to taste the sweetness of the utterance that has appeared from the mouth of the will of the All-Merciful, he would spend all that he possesses, even if it be the treasures of the entire earth, to uphold one of His commands which have dawned from the horizon of care and grace.

4 Say, from My laws the fragrance of My garment is diffused, and through them the banners of victory are hoisted on the hills and heights. The tongue of My power has spoken in the dominion of My greatness, addressing My creation: “Carry out My ordinances out of love for My beauty.” Blessed is the lover who has inhaled the fragrance of the Beloved from this word, from which the breezes of bounty have wafted in an indescribable manner. By My life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of grace will circle around My commands which have shone forth from the horizon of creativity.

5 Do not think that We have merely revealed to you the laws; rather, We have unsealed the choice sealed wine with the fingers of might and power. This is attested by what has been sent down by the Pen of Revelation. Reflect, O possessors of understanding.

## Prayer and Fasting

### Time of Day and Direction

6 Prayer has been prescribed for you, nine prostrations for Allah, the revealer of the verses, at noon, and in the early morning and evening. And we have forgiven another number, an order in the Book of Allah, it is indeed the capable, the chosen command. And when you want to pray, turn your faces towards the most holy, the sacred place, which God has made the circuit of the highest assembly and the face of the people of the cities of eternity, and the source of the command for those in the two earths and the heavens. And at the sunset of the truth and clarification, the place which we have determined for you, it is indeed the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

7 Everything has been fulfilled by His decree when the sun of the judgments rises from the horizon of the statement, it is upon everyone to follow it, even if by order, the skies of the hearts of religions would burst open from it. Indeed, He does what He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. And what the beloved has ruled is indeed beloved and the owner of invention. The one who found has recognized the Merciful and recognized the rise of this statement, indeed, he would receive arrows in his eyes to establish the judgments among people. Blessed is the one who accepted and won by the separation of the speech.

### The Prayer is Detailed in Another Document

8 We have detailed the prayer in another document. Blessed is the one who acts according to what was ordered from the owner of the necks. Six takbirs have been revealed in the prayer for the dead, from Allah, the revealer of the verses, and the one who has the knowledge of reading, he should read what was revealed before them, otherwise, God has forgiven him, indeed, He is the Mighty, the Forgiver.

### Hair And Other Materials Does Not Invalidate Prayer

9 Hair does not invalidate your prayer, nor what is prevented from the spirit such as bones and the like. Wear fur as you wear silk and squirrel, and what is less than them, it was not forbidden in the Quran, but it has been confused for the scholars. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

### Prayer and Fasting From Onset of Puberty

10 Prayer and fasting have been ordained for you from the onset of puberty, a command from your Lord and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Whoever has weakness in him due to illness or old age, God has forgiven him, a favor from Him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God has permitted you to prostrate on anything pure, and we have lifted from it the judgment of the limit in the book. Indeed, God knows and you do not know. Whoever does not find water, he mentions five times "in the name of Allah, the purest, the purest", then he commences the work. This is what the Lord of the worlds and the countries where the nights and the days are long have ruled. So let them pray by the hours and the aspects from which the times have been determined. Indeed, He is the Clear, the Wise.

### Prayer of the Verses

11 We have pardoned you for the prayer of the verses when they appear, remember Allah with greatness and power. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing. Say, the greatness is for Allah, Lord of what is seen and what is not seen, Lord of the worlds.

### No Congregational Prayer Except Funeral Prayer

12 The prayer has been ordained for you individually, the judgment of congregation has been lifted except in the funeral prayer. Indeed, He is the Wise in command.

### Menstrating Women Are Pardoned from Fasting and Prayer

13 Allah has pardoned women when they find blood from fasting and prayer, and they should perform ablution and glorify Him ninety-five times from noon to noon, "glorified is Allah of the rising and the beauty." This is what has been ordained in the book if you are among the knowledgeable.

### Prayer While On a Journey

14 And for you and for them in journeys, when you settle and find a secure place, let each prayer be a single prostration and remember in it, "Glory be to Allah, the possessor of greatness, majesty, endowment, and favors". And whoever is unable to say "Glory be to Allah", it is sufficient for him with the truth. Indeed, He is the sufficient, the everlasting, the forgiving, the merciful.

After completing the prostration, you and they should sit on the structure of monotheism and say eighteen times, "Glory be to Allah, the possessor of sovereignty and the kingdom." Thus does Allah clarify the paths of truth and guidance, and indeed, they lead to one way, which is this straight path. Thank Allah for this great favor. Praise Allah for this endowment that encompasses the heavens and the earth. Remember Allah for this mercy that has preceded the worlds.

15 Say, "Indeed, Allah has made the key to the hidden treasure my love. If you knew, without the key, it would remain concealed in the eternity of pre-existence, if you truly knew. Say, this is the source of revelation and the dawn of illumination, by which all horizons are lit, if you truly understood. Indeed, this is the confirmed decree, and by it every predetermined decree is established."

### Fasting For the Month Before the New Year

16 O Supreme Pen, say, "O people! We have prescribed fasting for you for a fixed number of days and have made the New Year a celebration for you after its completion. Thus, the sun of clarification has risen from the book's horizon by the command of the Originator and the Returner.

### Prior to Fasting, Festival of "Ha"

Make the additional days before the month of fasting, which we have made manifestations of the letter "Ha" among the nights and days. When defined by the borders of the year and the months, the people of glory should feed themselves, their relatives, then the poor and the needy, and they should celebrate, glorify, praise, and magnify their Lord in joy and happiness.

### Fasting Excused For Traveler, Sick, Pregnant, and Nursing

When the days of giving before restraint have been completed, they should enter into fasting. This is the decree of the Lord of the people. There is no hardship upon the traveler, the sick, the pregnant, and the nursing. Allah has excused them as a favor from Him, for He is the Mighty, the Bestower."

### Fast From Sunrise to Sunset

17 These are the limits of Allah, which are inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the parchment and the tablets. Hold firmly to the commands and judgments of Allah, and do not be among those who take the roots of their selves and discard the roots of Allah behind their backs because they have followed their suspicions and illusions.

Refrain yourselves from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. Beware that your desires do not prevent you from this bounty, which has been determined in the book.

### Ablutions

18 It has been decreed for those who believe in Allah, the Judge, to wash their hands and then their faces every day. Then they should sit facing Allah and recite ninety-five times, "Allah is the most glorious." This is the command of the Creator of the sky, Who has established Himself on the throne of names with majesty and power. Thus, you should perform ablution for the prayer, a command from Allah, the One, the Chosen.

## Harming Others

19 You have been forbidden to kill, commit adultery, backbite, and slander. Avoid what you have been prohibited from in the scriptures and tablets.

## Inheritance

20 We have divided the inheritance according to the number of the letter ز (Za). This was decreed for your offspring in the book of ط (Ta) according to the number of مقت (displeasure). For the spouses, it was decided in the book of ح (Ha) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ف (Fa). For the fathers, it was written in the book of ز (Za) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ك (Kaf).

For the mothers, it was determined in the book of و (Waw) according to the number of رفيع (exalted). For the brothers, it was mentioned in the book of ه (Ha) the number of ش (Shin). For the sisters, it was stated in the book of د (Dal) the number of ر (Ra) and م (Meem). For the teachers, it was noted in the book of ج (Jeem) the number of ق (Qaf) and ف (Fa).

This is how it was judged by the heralds who mention Me in the nights and at dawn. When we heard the noise of the offspring in the loins, we doubled what was for them and reduced from the other. He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, and He does with His authority as He pleases.

21 If someone passes away and has no offspring, their rights revert back to the House of Justice so that the trustees of the Merciful may distribute it among orphans, widows, and what benefits the majority of the people, so they may give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving.

22 And for the one who has offspring but does not have what was specified in the scripture, two-thirds of what he left go to his offspring and one-third goes to the House of Justice. Thus is the decree of the Mighty, the Supreme in dignity and grandeur.

23 And for the one who has no inheritors but has close relatives from the children of his brother, sister, and their daughters, they receive two-thirds. If not, it goes to the paternal uncles, aunts, maternal uncles, aunts, and those after them, to their sons and daughters. The remaining one-third goes back to the House of Justice. This is a decree in the scripture from Allah, the owner of all souls.

24 Whoever dies without any of the designated inheritors as per the divine decree from the Most High Pen, all of their wealth is returned to the aforementioned House of Justice, to be distributed as per God's command. Indeed, He is the All-Powerful, the Commander.

25 We have designated the inhabited dwelling and the specific clothing for the male descendants, not the females, and the inheritors. Indeed, He is the Bestower, the Overflowing.

26 Indeed, those who die during their father's lifetime and have descendants, they will inherit what belongs to their father as written in the Book of Allah. Distribute among them with pure justice. Thus, the sea of speech has surged and cast forth the pearls of judgments from the Sovereign of all beings.

27 And for those who leave behind weak descendants, hand over their inheritance to a trustworthy guardian who will invest it for them until they reach maturity or the stipulated partnership age. Then, assign the guardian a right from what has been gained from the trade and business.

28 All of this is to be done after the payment of Allah's right, if there are any debts on the deceased, and the preparation of means for shrouding and burial, and carrying the deceased with dignity and honor. Thus, is the decree of the Master of the Beginning and the End.

29 Say: This is the hidden knowledge that will not change, for it began with the 'Ta' symbolizing the stored name, the Manifest, the Forbidden, the Impenetrable. And what we have designated for the offspring is from Allah's favor upon them, so they may thank their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. These are the limits set by Allah, do not transgress them by your own desires. Follow what you have been commanded from the source of the statement, and the sincere ones see the boundaries of Allah as the water of life for the people of religions, and the lamp of wisdom and success for those on the earth and in the heavens.

## The House of Justice in Every City

30 Allah has decreed for every city to establish a House of Justice where souls gather in number equal to 'Bahá' (9), and if it increases, there is no harm. They should feel as though they are entering the presence of Allah, the Most High, the Supreme, seeing Him who is unseen. They should act as trustees of the Merciful among possibilities and as deputies of Allah for all who are on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants for the sake of Allah, just as they consult on their own affairs, and choose what is most select. Such is the decree of your Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving. Beware of neglecting what is specified in the Tablet. Fear Allah, O people of insight.

## Houses In The Name of the Lord of All Religions

31 O concourse of creation, build houses as perfectly as possible in all places in the name of the Lord of all religions in the lands, and adorn them as befits them, not with images and likenesses. Then remember your Lord, the Merciful, in them with spirit and fragrance. It is through His remembrance that hearts are illuminated and eyes are pleased.

## Pilgrimage to the House

32 God has ordained for those among you who are capable to perform the pilgrimage to the House, except for women, from whom He has excused, as a mercy from Him. Indeed, He is the Giver, the Bestower.

## Engagement in an Occupation is Worship

33 O people of Baha, it is obligatory for each of you to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, farming, and the like. We have regarded your engagement in these as equivalent to worship for God, the Truth. Reflect, O people, on the mercy of God and His grace, then thank Him at dawn and dusk.

Do not waste your time in idleness and laziness, but engage in that which benefits yourselves and others. Thus has the matter been decreed in this Tablet, from whose horizon has shone the sun of wisdom and explanation. The most despised of people before God are those who sit idle and beg. Grasp the rope of means, relying on God, the Cause of causes.

## Repent to God Only

34 It has been forbidden for you in this Book to kiss hands. This is what you have been prohibited from by your Lord, the Mighty, the Judge. No one should seek forgiveness from another. Repent to God sincerely. He is indeed the Forgiving, the Giver, the Mighty, the Relenting.

## Stand Up In Service of the Command

35 O servants of the Merciful, stand up in service of the command, no matter the situation, lest grief from those who disbelieve in the appearance of the signs overtake you. When the promise came and what was promised became apparent, people disagreed and each party clung to what they had of conjectures and illusions.

## Do Not Deprive Yourself of What God Allows

36 Among people, there are those who humble themselves like the straps of sandals, seeking the chest of glory. Say, "Who are you, O negligent and deceitful one?" And among them are those who claim to comprehend the innermost and the innermost of the innermost. Say, "O liar, by God, you have nothing. Indeed, it is the outer layers that we have left for you, just as bones are left for dogs. By God, the truth is, if one were to wash the feet of the world and worship God in the thickets, the wilderness, the mountains, the valleys, and the hilltops, and at every stone, tree, meadow, and never deviates from it, my approval would never be accepted." This is what the Lord of all beings has decreed.

How many a servant has secluded himself in the islands of India, depriving himself of what God has permitted him, enduring hardships and tribulations, yet does not mention before God the station of the signs. Do not make your actions a partnership of hopes, and do not deprive yourselves of this goal, which was the hope of the near ones in the primordial past. Say, "The spirit of actions is my satisfaction, and everything is contingent upon my acceptance." Read the tablets so you may know what is intended in the books of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Whoever succeeds in my love, it is his right to sit on the bed of contentment in the heart of existence. As for the one who is deprived, even if he were to sit on the ground, he seeks refuge from it with God, the Lord of all religions.

## Asserting a Proclamation Before a Thousand Years

37 Whoever makes a proclamation or asserts something before the completion of a full thousand years, they are undoubtedly a liar and fabricator. We pray to God to guide them towards retraction if they express remorse. Indeed, He is the Forgiver. If they persist in their claim, a merciless punishment will befall them, for He is severe in retribution. Anyone who interprets or explains this verse in a way that deviates from its apparent meaning is deprived of God's Spirit and His mercy, which predated all worlds. Fear God and do not follow your illusions. Comply with what your Mighty and Wise Lord instructs you. The uproar will emerge from most lands. Steer clear of it, O people, and do not follow every immoral, contemptible person. This we have informed you of when we were in Iraq, in the land of secrecy, and in this radiant scene.

## Rise to the Defense of God's Cause

38 O people of the Earth, when the sun of my beauty sets and the sky of my structure is concealed, do not be disturbed. Rise to the defense of my cause and the elevation of my word among all the worlds. Indeed, we are with you in every circumstance, and we will support you with the truth. Indeed, we have been capable. Whoever recognizes me, shall serve me with a dedication that the armies of heavens and earth cannot deter.

39 Indeed, people are asleep; if they were to awaken, they would hasten with their hearts to the All-Knowing, Wise God, and discard what they have, even if it were all the treasures of the world, so that their Lord may remember them with a word from Him. This is how He informs you from Him, knowledge of the unseen in a Tablet of what has appeared in the possible and what He alone has been informed of, the One who is in charge of all the worlds.

The intoxication of desire has overtaken them so that they do not see the Master of the universe, whose call has risen from all directions, "There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise."

### Blessed Are Days In Remembrance of God

40 Say, "Do not rejoice in what you have possessed in the evening and at dawn; someone else will possess it. Thus, the All-Knowing, the Expert informs you. Say, have you seen what you have as a permanent or lasting? No, and by My Merciful Self, if you were fair, you would see your days passing like the winds and your glory folding up like that of the ancients. Contemplate, O people, where are your past days and where are your wasted times. Blessed are the days that passed in the remembrance of God, and the times that were spent in His wise remembrance.

### No Glory For Might, No Adornments for the Rich

By My Life, there will be no glory for the mighty, no adornments for the rich, no thorns for the wretched. Everything will perish by a word from Him, for He is the Capable, the Mighty, the Powerful. What people have of furnishings does not benefit them, and they have been negligent of what would benefit them. They will become aware and will not find what they have missed in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If they knew, they would spend what they have to remember their names by the Throne, but they are among the dead."

### Don't Be Deceived By Your Knowledge

41 Among the people are those who are deceived by their knowledge, and with it, they are barred from my everlasting name. When they hear the sound of footsteps behind them, they see themselves greater than Nimrod. Say, "Where is he, O you who are rejected? By God, he is indeed in the depths of Hell.

Say, "O assembly of scholars, do you not hear the creaking of my supreme pen, and do not you see this rising sun from the most glorious horizon? Why do you stay attached to the idols of your whims? Leave your illusions and turn towards God, your ancient master."

## Endowments Meant For Good Deeds

42 The endowments specifically meant for good deeds have returned to God, the revealer of signs. No one has the right to dispose of them except after permission from the source of revelation, and after him, the decision reverts to the branches, and after them to the House of Justice, once its order is established in the lands, so that they may spend it in the elevated lands in this matter and in what they have been commanded by the potent, capable one.

Otherwise, they should revert to the people of Bahá, who do not speak except after his permission, and do not rule except by what God has ruled in this Tablet. These are the supporters of victory between the heavens and the earth, to spend it on what has been specified in the Book from a Mighty, Generous one.

## Seek A Course Between Two Extremes

43 Do not despair in times of adversity, nor rejoice excessively. Seek a course between the two extremes. It is to be mindful in such a state and alert to what will befall you in the end. Thus, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise informs you.

## Hair

44 Do not shave your heads, for God has adorned them with hair. Indeed, in this are signs for those who contemplate the natural order as decreed by the Creator of all creatures. He is indeed the Mighty, the Wise. Moreover, it is not appropriate to exceed the limit of the ears. This is what the Lord of the Worlds has decreed.

## Justice For the Thief

45 For the thief, the verdict has been decreed as exile and imprisonment, and for the third offense, put a mark on his forehead that he may be recognized, so that he may not be welcomed into the cities of God and His homes. Beware that you do not let mercy cloud your judgement in the law of God. Act as you have been commanded by the Compassionate, Merciful One. We have nurtured you with the whips of wisdom and judgment for your own preservation and elevation, as parents nurture their children. By My life, if you knew what we intended for you with our sacred commands, you would offer your lives for this sacred, powerful, and impregnable cause.

## Use Utensils and Be Refined

46 Whoever wishes to use utensils of gold and silver, there is no harm upon them. Beware that your hands do not delve into vulgar and cheap utensils. Opt for what is closer to refinement, as He wishes to see you uphold the manners of the inhabitants of Paradise in His invincible and impregnable kingdom.

Adhere to refinement in all circumstances, lest your eyes fall upon what you and the inhabitants of Paradise dislike. Whoever overlooks it, his work shall be nullified immediately, yet if he has an excuse, God will forgive him. Indeed, He is the Powerful, the Generous.

## God Is The Only Infallibility

47 The one who manifests the command is not to be associated with the Greater Infallibility. Indeed, he is the one who exercises his will in the realm of creation. God has exclusively destined this status for Himself, and no share of this mighty, impregnable matter has been allotted to anyone else. This is the command of God, which has been concealed behind the veils of the unseen. We have unveiled it in this manifestation, and with it, we have torn the veil of those who have not recognized the ruling of the Book and have been among the heedless.

## Fathers Must Educate His Children

48 It is ordained that every father must educate his son and daughter in knowledge and writing, as well as in other matters specified in the Tablet. If a father fails to fulfill these responsibilities, the trustees are to take from him what is necessary for their education, if he is affluent. Otherwise, the matter should be referred to the House of Justice. We have made it a refuge for the poor and needy. Indeed, whoever nurtures his child or a child from among the children, it is as if he has nurtured one of my children. Upon him is My Glory, My Care, and My Mercy, which precede all worlds.

## Fine For Adultery

49 God has decreed for every adulterer and adulteress a fine to be paid to the House of Justice, which is nine mithqals of gold. If they repeat the offense, double the penalty. This is the judgment given by the Possessor of all Names in both the former and the latter case, a humiliating punishment has been prescribed for them.

However, if anyone is afflicted with a sin, they have the opportunity to repent and return to God. Indeed, He forgives whom He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. Indeed, He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.

## Don't Seek Glory

50 Beware lest the clamor of glory prevents you from the sweetness of this humble stream. Take the cups of prosperity in this morning in the name of the Cleaver of the Dawn, then drink with the remembrance of Him, the Mighty, the Inventive.

## Music Is a Ladder For the Soul

51 We have permitted for you the sounds and melodies. Beware lest the sounds divert you from the affairs of manners and dignity. Rejoice with the joy of My Greatest Name by which hearts have turned and the minds of those close have been attracted. We have made it a ladder for the souls to ascend to the highest horizon. Do not make it a wing of self and passion. I seek refuge that you become of the ignorant.

## Blood Money To the House of Justice

52 We have returned a third of all the blood money to the seat of justice, and we counsel its men to be purely just. They should dispense what has gathered with them as they have been commanded from the all-knowing, wise. O men of justice, be the shepherds of God's flock in His kingdom and protect them from the wolves who have appeared in clothing, just as you protect your children. Thus counsels you the trustworthy adviser.

## Wisdom in Baha'u'llah's Absence

53 If you disagree about a matter, return it to God as long as the sun is rising from the horizon of this sky. And when it sets, refer to what has been revealed from Him. Indeed, it is sufficient for all the worlds.

Say, O people, do not let confusion overtake you when the kingdom of my revelation is obscured and the waves of the sea of my explanation are stilled. Indeed, there is wisdom in my appearance and another wisdom in my absence, which only God, the Singular, the Knowledgeable, knows. And we see you from my most glorious horizon, and we help those who stand to support my cause with troops from the highest assembly and hosts of the nearest angels.

## Detachment

54 O hosts of the earth, by the Truth, indeed sweet, flavorful rivers have burst forth from the rocks due to the sweetness of the discourse of your chosen Lord, and you are among the oblivious. Leave what is with you, then fly with the steps of detachment above the plane of creation. Thus, the Master of invention, who by the movement of His pen turned the worlds upside, commands you.

55 Do you know from which horizon your most Glorious Lord is calling you? Do you know from which pen your Lord, the Master of names, is commanding you? No, by My life, if you knew, you would abandon the world, turning with all your hearts toward the direction of the Beloved, and the vibration of the Word would affect you so profoundly that the greater world would shake, let alone this lesser world. Thus, the rains of My bounty have poured from the sky of My providence, a favor from Me, so that you might be among the grateful.

## Penalty For Fighting and Hitting

56 As for fighting and hitting, their rulings vary according to their severity, and the judge's ruling is for each severity a specific fine. Indeed, He is the Decisive, the Mighty, the Impenetrable. If we wish, we can detail it truthfully and according to a promise from us. Indeed, He is the Fulfilling, the Knowing.

## Extend Hospitality Monthly

57 It is decreed upon you to extend hospitality once every month, even if only with water. Indeed, God intends to bring hearts together, even through the causes of heavens and earths.

## Be Like Fingers In a Hand

58 Beware lest the affairs of the self and desires separate you. Be like the fingers in a hand and the pillars of the body. Thus does the Pen of Revelation counsel you, if indeed you are of the assured.

59 Look then upon the mercy of God and His favours. Indeed, He commands you what benefits you, even though He is independent of all the worlds. Your wrongdoings cannot harm Us, just as your good deeds cannot benefit Us. We only call you for the sake of God. Every knowledgeable and discerning one bears witness to this.

## Avoid Excess in Hunting

60 When you send your hunting animals after game, remember God at that moment. Then, what they catch for you is permissible, even if you find it already dead. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.

Avoid excess in this regard. Be on the path of justice and fairness in all matters. Thus commands you the source of all revelation, if indeed you are among those who understand.

## Show Kindness to Kin, No Right in People's Wealth

61 Verily, God has commanded you to show kindness to your kin, and He has not ordained for them any right in people's wealth. Indeed, He is the Self-Sufficient, independent of all the worlds.

## Arson and Murder Penalties

62 Whoever intentionally burns a house, burn him, and whoever deliberately kills a person, kill him. Implement God's laws with the hands of power and authority, then abandon the ways of ignorance. And if you decide to sentence them to eternal imprisonment, there is no blame on you in the book. Indeed, He is the judge over what He wishes.

## Marriage

### One Wife Best, Two Wives Allowed

63 God has ordained marriage for you. Beware of exceeding two wives, and whoever is satisfied with one woman, his soul and hers will be at ease. And whoever takes a virgin for his service, there is no blame on him. Thus, the matter has been inscribed by the pen of revelation in truth. Marry, oh people, so that among you may appear those who will remember me among my servants. This is a command from me to you. Take it as a source of aid for yourselves.

### Do Not Spread Corruption

64 Oh assembly of creation, do not follow your own selves, for they indeed urge you towards wrongdoing and obscenity. Follow the Master of all things, who commands you to do good and to be righteous. Indeed, He is independent of all worlds. Beware not to spread corruption on Earth after its reformation. And whoever spreads corruption, indeed, he is not one of us, and we disavow him. Thus, the command is from the sky of revelation, witnessing the truth.

### Marriage Requires Consent of Parents

65 He has indeed stipulated in the scripture that it is with the satisfaction of both parties. When we desired love, affection, and unity among servants, we therefore attached it with the permission of the parents, so that no enmity or hatred would arise between them. We have other objectives in it as well. Thus, the command has been determined.

### Dowry

66 Dowry can only be validated by Mahr (marital gift). For cities, nineteen weights of pure gold have been set as Mahr, and for villages, it is in silver. If one wishes to increase it, it is prohibited for him to exceed ninety-five weights. Thus, the command was inscribed with dignity. And he who is content with the first degree (minimum Mahr) it is better for him according to the scripture. Indeed, He grants abundance to whom He wills through the means of the heavens and the earth. And Allah has power over everything.

### A Spouse Must Provide Future Rendezvous With Partner

67 Allah has ordained for every servant intending to leave his homeland, to set a rendezvous for his partner, a period of any length he desires. If he arrives and fulfills his promise, he is indeed following his Master's command and is among the benefactors, as written by the pen of command. Unless he excuses himself for a legitimate reason, he should inform his partner and put maximum effort into returning to her. If he defaults on both matters, she has a waiting period of nine counted months. After completing them, there is no harm for her in choosing a husband. But if she is patient, indeed, He loves those who are patient among women and men. Follow My commands and do not follow every idolater who is sinful in the Tablet.

If news arrives during her waiting period, she can take what is reasonable; indeed, He desires reconciliation between servants and women. Beware not to commit actions that cause stubbornness among you. Thus, the command is decided, and the promise is fulfilled. If she receives news of his death or murder and it is confirmed by spreading news or two just persons, she has the right to stay in the house if specified months have passed. She has a choice in what she chooses. This is what is ruled by the one who has power over the command.

### A Year of Patience Before Divorce

68 If there occurs between them a period of discord or dislike, he has no right to divorce her, and he has the right to be patient for a complete year, perhaps a scent of love may emerge between them. And if the year is completed and love has not blossomed, there is no harm in divorce, indeed He is wise in all matters.

Allah has forbidden you from what you did after three divorces, as a favor from Him so you may be among the grateful, recorded in a Tablet by the pen of command. And he who divorces has the option to return after the completion of each month with affection and satisfaction unless she is fortified. And when she is fortified, the separation is confirmed with the last bond and the matter is decided except after clear command. Thus, the command was from the brilliance of beauty, recorded in the Tablet of Majesty with veneration.

### Discord Between Spouses While Travelling

69 And he who travels, and she travels with him, then discord occurs between them, he has the right to provide her with a full year's expenditure and return her to the residence from which she departed, or he can entrust her to a trustworthy person, and what she needs for the journey to bring her back to her place. Indeed, your Lord rules as He wishes, with an authority that encompasses the worlds.

### Reconciliation Better Than Divorce

70 And the one who was divorced, on whom wrongdoing has been proven, there is no expenditure for her during her waiting period. Thus, the directive was clear from the horizon of justice. Indeed, God loves reconciliation and harmony and detests separation and divorce. Live, O people, with spirit and fragrant (benevolence). By my life, everyone in existence will perish, and what remains is good deeds. Indeed, God is a witness to what I say. O my servants, reconcile amongst yourselves, then listen to what the highest pen advises you, and do not follow a wicked tyrant.

71 Beware that the world does not deceive you, as it has deceived people before you. Follow the limits of God and His paths, then tread this path that was extended in truth. Indeed, those who have cast aside wrongdoing and nonsense and embraced piety, they are among the best of creation according to the truth. They are remembered by the highest assembly and the inhabitants of this station that has been elevated in the name of God.

## No Trade in Slaves and Children

72 God has forbidden you to trade in slaves and children. No servant is to buy another servant; this is a prohibition in the Tablet of God. So is the order inscribed with justice and bounty. And no one should boast over anyone else, everyone has their highs and lows, signifying that there is no deity but Him. Indeed, He is wise over all things.

## Support the Creator with Good Deeds, Wisdom, Clarity

73 Adorn yourselves with the embroidery of good deeds. Those who excel in acting in His pleasure, they indeed are the people of splendor and are mentioned near the throne.

Support the Creator of all beings with good deeds, then with wisdom and clarity. This is how you have been commanded in many of the tablets from The Most Merciful. Indeed, He is knowledgeable of what I say. No one should harm another, nor should a life take a life. This is what you have been forbidden in a book that was kept in a pavilion of honor. Would you kill those whom God has brought to life with a spirit from Him? This is a great mistake before the throne. Fear God, and do not destroy what God has built with the hands of oppression and tyranny. Then take the path to truth when the armies of knowledge have emerged with the banners of clarity, all the tribes of religions are defeated, except for those who wish to drink from the river of life in divine pleasure, they were present from the spirit of the Praised One.

## Purity, Purifying, and Gentleness

74 God has decreed purity for the water of the sperm as a mercy from Him to the creatures. Praise Him with spirituality and fragrance, and do not follow those who are far from the rise of closeness. Stand up for the service of the command in all circumstances. He supports you with authority that encompasses all worlds. Hold on to the rope of gentleness, so no traces of filth are seen on your clothes. This is what has been decreed by the One who is gentler than all gentle. And for the one who has an excuse, there is no harm upon him, for He is the Forgiver, the Merciful. Purify every disliked thing with water that has not changed by a third. Beware of using water that has changed due to air or something else. Be the element of gentleness among creatures. This is what your Powerful, Wise Master desires for you.

75 And thus God has elevated the rule of purity above all things and other creeds, a gift from God, for He is the Forgiving, the Generous. Everything has been immersed in the sea of purity at the beginning of Divine pleasure when we revealed ourselves to everyone in the universe with our beautiful names and superior attributes. This is from My grace that encompasses all the worlds, so you may interact with the religions and communicate the command of your Merciful Lord. This is for the crown of deeds if you are from the knowledgeable ones.

## Be Pure in Prayer

76 And He ruled with the greatest kindness, and the washing of what has been tarnished by dust, and the freezing of dirt, and beneath it. Fear God and be among those who purify. And he who sees filth in his garments, surely his prayers do not ascend to God, and the high-ranked avoid him.

Use rose water, then pure perfume. This is what God loved from the First, who has no beginning, so that what your Mighty, Wise Lord wanted might emerge from you.

## Sciences That Benefit You

77 God has pardoned you for what was mentioned in the scriptures about the erasure of books, and has granted you permission to read from the sciences what benefits you, not what leads to argumentation in speech. This is better for you, if indeed you are among those who know.

## To the Assembly of Kings

78 O assembly of kings, the Sovereign has come and the kingdom belongs to Allah, the Guardian, the Everlasting. Worship none but Allah, and direct your hearts, illuminated, towards the face of your Lord, the Master of Names. This command is incomparable to what you have, if indeed you understand.

### Wealth Distracts From the Ultimate Purpose

79 Indeed, We see you rejoice in what you have gathered for others, yet depriving yourselves of the worlds that none but the Preserved Tablet has enumerated. Wealth has distracted you from the ultimate purpose; this is not befitting for you, if only you knew. Purify your hearts from the dregs of the world, hastening towards the dominion of your Lord, the Originator of the earth and the heavens, by whom the earthquakes have appeared and the tribes have lamented. Except those who have rejected the masses and embraced what has been commanded in the hidden Tablet.

80 This is a day when the speaker triumphs with the lights of the Ancient One and drinks the crystal clear waters of union from this cup that stirred the oceans. Say, by God, the truth is that the Mount orbits around the place of appearance, and the spirit calls from the dominion, "Come forth and ascend, O sons of vanity."

This is a day when the mountain of God rushed with longing for His meeting and Zion cried out, "The promise has come, and what was written in the Tablets of God, the Most High, the Mighty, the Beloved, has appeared."

### The Greater Law is Revealed

81 O assembly of kings, the Greater Law has been revealed in the luminous scene, and every hidden matter has appeared from the hands of the Master of Destiny. By Him, the Hour has come, the moon has split, and every decreed matter has been detailed.

### The Kings are the Subjects - Rise to Serve

82 O assembly of kings, you are the subjects, the Sovereign has appeared in the most beautiful design and invites you to Himself, the Preserver, the Sustainer. Beware that arrogance does not prevent you from the rising place of Manifestation, or that the world does not veil you from the Creator of the heavens. Rise to serve the Intended One, who created you with a Word from Himself and made you the manifestations of power for what has been and what will be.

83 By God, we do not wish to interfere in your kingdoms, but we have come to change hearts, for they are the mirrors of glory. The kingdom of names bears witness to this if you understand. And he who follows his Lord indeed turns away from the entire world, and how commendable is this praised position! Leave your homes and then turn to the kingdom. This is what benefits you in the hereafter and the first. The owner of the dominion bears witness to this if you know.

84 Blessed is the king who has stood for the support of My Cause in My Kingdom and has cut off from all else. Indeed, he is among the companions of the Crimson Ark, which God has made for the people of glory. It is fitting for everyone to honor him, respect him, and support him so that he may open cities with the keys of My Dominant Name to those in the kingdoms of the unseen and witnessed.

Indeed, he is like the vision for the humans, the most resplendent luminary for the forehead of creation, and the head of generosity for the body of the world. O people of glory, support him with your wealth and souls.

## To the Emperor of Austria (Franz Joseph I)

85 O King of Austria! The dawn of Divine Unity emerged in the prison of Akka. You passed by the Al-Aqsa Mosque but never inquired after it. With it, every house was elevated and every exalted door was opened. We have made it the focus of the world for My remembrance, but you have discarded the mentioned one as it emerged in the Kingdom of your God, the Lord of all worlds. We have been with you in all conditions and found you clinging to the branch, oblivious of the root. Indeed, your Lord bears witness to what I say.

Our hearts are filled with sorrow at seeing you revolving around Our name, yet not recognizing Us before your face. Open your eyes, so you may behold this noble sight, recognize the One you call upon in nights and days, and see the luminous light emerging from this gleaming horizon.

## To the King of Berlin (Otto von Bismarck)

86 Say, O King of Berlin, hear the call from this manifest temple that there is no deity but Me, the Everlasting, the Single, the Ancient. Beware that arrogance prevents you from the dawn of manifestation or desire veils you from the Owner of the heavens and the earth. So advises you the Most High Pen, for He is the Gracious, the Generous. Remember those who were greater than you in status and higher than you in rank, where are they and what is with them? Be alert and do not be among those who are asleep. Indeed, he rejected the Tablet of God and saw it when we informed him of what was brought upon us by the armies of the oppressors.

Therefore, humiliation overtook him from all sides until he returned to dust with great loss. O King, reflect upon him and upon others like you who mocked the lands and ruled over the people. The Merciful has brought them down from the palaces to the graves. Take a lesson and be among those who remember.

87 Indeed, we seek nothing from you. We only advise you for the sake of God and we patiently endure as we endured what has come upon us from you, O assembly of sovereigns.

## To the Kings and Leaders of the Americas

88 O kings of America and leaders of its republics, listen to what the greenery sings on the branch of eternity: There is no god but I, the Everlasting, the Forgiving, the Generous.

Adorn the temple of the kingdom with the design of justice and piety, and crown its head with a wreath of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus commands you the source of the Names, from the All-Knowing, the Wise.

The Promised One has appeared in this praiseworthy place, with which the existence smiles from the unseen and witnessed. Seize the day of God, for meeting Him is better for you than anything upon which the sun rises, if you are among those who know.

O assembly of rulers, hear what has arisen from the source of majesty: There is no god but I, the Speaker, the Knowledgeable. Repair the broken with the hands of justice, and break the oppressive correct one with the whip of the commands of your Wise Lord.

## To the Assembly of Rome (Constantinople)

89 O assembly of Rome, we hear amongst you the sound of an owl. Has the intoxication of passion overtaken you, or were you among the heedless?

O you, the point located at the coast of the two seas, the seat of oppression has been established upon you, and the fire of hatred has ignited within you, about which the Highest Assembly and those who circulate around the exalted throne lament.

We see in you the ignorant ruling over the wise, and the darkness boasting over the light, and indeed you are in clear delusion. Your apparent beauty has deceived you, it will perish, by the Lord of Creatures. And the daughters, the widows, and the tribes within you will wail. Thus informs you the All-Knowing, the Aware.

## The Rhine Covered in Blood

90 O banks of the Rhine, we have seen you covered in blood because of the retributive swords unleashed upon you, and for you there will be another time. And we hear the lament of Berlin, even though today it stands in apparent glory.

## To The Land of Ṭā (Tehran)

91 O land of Ṭā, do not grieve for anything. God has made you a source of joy for all the worlds. If He wishes, He could bless your homeland with someone who rules with justice and gathers the scattered sheep of God from the wolves. Indeed, He presents the people of glory with joy and expansion. Indeed, this is from the essence of creation in the sight of the Truth. By the Glory of God and the glory of all who are in the dominion of His command at all times.

92 Rejoice in what God has made you: the horizon of light, as in you appeared the dawning-place of the Manifestation and you were named by this Name which has lit up the lamp of grace and illuminated the heavens and the earth.

93 The state of affairs will be reversed in you and the majority of people will judge upon you. Indeed, your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Encompassing. Be at ease with the grace of your Lord; His favor will never cease from you. Tranquility will embrace you after turmoil. Such is the decree in the magnificent Book.

## To The Land of Kha (Khurasan)

94 O Land of 'Kh', we hear within you the voice of men in the remembrance of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed be the day when the banners of the Names will be hoisted in the Kingdom of Creation with My most glorious Name. On that day, the faithful will rejoice with the victory of God, and the polytheists will mourn.

95 No one should interfere with those who govern over the people. Leave what they have to them and turn your attention towards the hearts.

96 O Great Sea, shower upon the nations what you have been commanded by the Eternal Sovereign, and adorn the temples of humanity with the patterns of wisdom that gladden hearts and delight eyes.

## Purify Your Wealth

97 And he who possesses a hundred weights of gold, nineteen weights are for God, the Creator of the earth and the heavens. Beware, O people, not to withhold yourselves from this immense bounty. We have commanded you this after being independent of you and everyone in the heavens and earth. Indeed, in this is a decree and benefits which no one has knowledge of except God, the Knowing, the Informed. Say, it is intended to purify your wealth and bring you closer to stations that none can reach except by the will of God. He is indeed the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous. O people, do not be unfaithful in the rights of God and do not dispense it except with His permission. So is the decree in the Tablets and in this impregnable Tablet. Whoever betrays God is met with just retribution, and he who acts as commanded receives blessings from the sky of his Lord's generous gift, the Giver, the Provider, the Ancient.

He intends for you what you do not know today, people will know when the spirits soar and the carpets of joy are folded. Thus, he reminds you from him is an inscribed Tablet.

98 Various petitions have arrived at the Throne from those who believed and they asked God, the Lord of what can be seen and what cannot be seen, the Lord of the Worlds. Therefore, we revealed the Tablet and adorned it with the design of the Command so that people might act in accordance with their Lord's rulings. Likewise, we were asked before in consecutive years and we withheld the Pen, a wisdom from Us, until numbered souls were present in those days. Therefore, we answered them with the truth, with what gives life to hearts.

## To the Assembly of Scholars

### Do Not Use Your Own Principles and Sciences

99 Say, O assembly of scholars, do not weigh the Book of God against your own principles and sciences. It is indeed the balance of truth among creation. What is with the nations is to be weighed by this great balance, and it by itself, if you but knew.

100 My watchful eye weeps for you, because you have not recognized the One you invoke in the dusk and dawn, and at every sunset and sunrise. Turn, O people, with bright faces and radiant hearts towards the blessed crimson spot where the Lote Tree of the ultimate end proclaims, "There is no deity but I, the Overseer, the Self-Sustaining."

101 O assembly of scholars, can any of you dare to engage with me in the arena of unveiling and gnosis, or to traverse the track of wisdom and explanation? No, by my Lord, the Compassionate, all upon it shall perish, and this is the countenance of your beloved and mighty Lord.

## To the People

102 O people, we have indeed ordained knowledge for the recognition of the Known, yet you have used it to veil yourselves from its source, from which every concealed matter has been revealed. If you truly understood the horizon from which the sun of discourse has risen, you would abandon creation and all that is with them, and you would turn to the praised station.

103 Say, this is the sky in which the mother of the book, the source of all knowledge, is contained if you truly comprehend. This is the one with which the rock cried out and the Lote-Tree called out on the elevated mount, on the blessed land. Sovereignty belongs to God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Loving.

104 Indeed, we did not enter schools nor did we study various subjects. Listen to what this unlettered one calls you to, towards the eternal God. Indeed, it is better for you than what is stored in the earth, if you understand.

## Do Not Interpret and Deviate From Its Apparent Meaning

105 Indeed, the one who interprets what has descended from the heavens of revelation and deviates it from its apparent meaning, they are the ones who distort the supreme word of God, and they are among the losers as is clear in the Book.

## Trim Your Nails and Bath Weekly

106 It has been decreed for you to trim your nails and immerse your bodies in water every week, and clean your bodies with what you have used before. Beware, let not negligence keep you from what you are commanded by the Mighty, the Great. Immerse in fresh water, and it is not permissible to immerse in used water. Beware, do not approach the latrines of the foreigners. Whoever aims for it, will find its foul smell even before entering it. Avoid it, O people, and do not be among the humiliated.

It is likened to pus and dirt if you are knowledgeable. And so are their foul-smelling enclosures. Leave them and be among the sanctified. We wished to see you as the manifestations of paradise on earth so that what sprouts from you will bring joy to the hearts of the near ones. The one who pours water on himself and cleans his body with it is better for him and it spares him the immersion. He wanted to make matters easy for you as a grace from Him, so that you may be among the thankful.

## Do Not Marry Your Fathers' Wives or Young Boys

107 It has been forbidden for you to marry your fathers' wives. We feel ashamed to even mention the rule regarding young boys. Fear the Merciful, O inhabitants of all places, and do not commit what you have been forbidden in the Tablet. And do not be among those who wander aimlessly in the meadows of lust.

## Engaging In the Remembrance of God In Designated Places

108 No one should move their tongue publicly when walking in the streets and markets. Instead, those who wish to engage in remembrance should do so in a place designated for the remembrance of God, or in their own homes. This is closer to sincerity and piety. Thus, the sun of wisdom has risen from the horizon of explanation. Blessed are those who act accordingly.

## Writing a Will

109 Every soul is obligated to write a will, and they have the right to adorn their will with the Greatest Name, confessing therein the oneness of God in the manifestation of His appearance. In the will, they can mention any benevolence they wish to be known for, so it may serve as a witness for them in the worlds of command and creation, and will become a treasure for them with their Lord, the Keeper, the Trustworthy.

## Two Greatest Feast Days

110 The holidays have concluded to the two greatest feast days. The first one is the days in which The Merciful manifested Himself to everyone through His Most Beautiful Names and Superior Attributes. The second is the day on which We sent one who gave the glad tidings to the people with this Name, through which the dead arose and gathered all those in the heavens, the earth, and the others, within two days. Thus, the matter has been decreed from an Order of the High.

## Victory on the First Day of the Month of Splendor

111 Blessed is the one who is victorious on the first day of the month of Splendor, which God has made for this great name. Blessed is the one who demonstrates God's bounty upon himself on this day. Indeed, he is the one who shows gratitude to God through actions that signify His grace that encompasses all the worlds. Say: Indeed, it is the beginning of the months and its initiator, and through it the breath of life passes over all possible existences. Blessed is the one who perceives it with spirit and sweet fragrance. We testify that he is among the successful ones.

## The Sovereign of Feasts

112 Say: Indeed, the Greatest Feast is the Sovereign of Feasts. Remember, O people, God's blessing upon you when you were asleep; He awakened you with the breezes of revelation and guided you to His clear, straight path.

## Seek Help From Wise Doctors

113 If you fall ill, seek help from the wise among doctors. We have not nullified the means; rather, we have confirmed them through this pen that God has made the source of His radiant command.

## A Requirement Has Been Pardoned

114 God has decreed for every soul to present itself before the Throne with what it possesses that has no equal. We have graciously pardoned this requirement from our side. Indeed, He is the Generous Giver.

## The Dawning Place of Remembrances

115 Blessed is the one who turns towards the Dawning-place of Remembrances in the early mornings, mindful, remembering, and seeking forgiveness. And when they enter, they sit silently, not interrupting the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say, the Dawning-place of Remembrances is every house built in My name in the cities and the villages. Thus, it is named in the presence of the Throne, if you are among those who know.

## Recite the Verses in the Most Beautiful Melodies

116 And those who recite the verses of the Compassionate in the most beautiful melodies, they will attain from them that which no dominion of the King of heavens and earths can match. And through them, they will discover the knowledge of worlds which are unknown today except to those who have been given sight from this noble perspective. Say, indeed, they attract pure hearts towards the spiritual worlds which cannot be described in words nor indicated by signs. Blessed are the listeners.

## Support Those Who Remember God and Raised His Word

117 Support, O people, my chosen ones who have stood in my remembrance among my creation and raised my word in my kingdom. They are the stars of the sky of my providence and the lamps of my guidance for all creatures. And he who speaks other than what has been revealed in the tablets is not from me. Beware of following every sinful claimant. The tablets have been adorned with the seal of the Dawn Splitter, who speaks between the heavens and the earths. Hold fast to the firm handhold and the strong, unbreakable rope of my command.

## Learning Different Languages

118 God has permitted whoever wishes to learn the different languages so as to convey God's command to the east and the west of the earth, and to mention Him among nations and religions, so that hearts may be drawn by it, and every dry bone may be revived by it.

## Unwise to Consume That Which Takes Away Reason

119 It is not for the wise to consume that which takes away reason, and one should act in a manner that befits a human being, not in the way that every careless, dubious person behaves.

## Honesty, Loyalty, Piety, Truthfulness, Manners

120 Adorn your heads with the crown of honesty and loyalty, your hearts with the robe of piety, your speech with pure truthfulness, and your bodies with the adornments of manners. All this is from the virtue of a human being if you are among those who contemplate. O people of Baha, hold onto the rope of servitude to the true God. With it, your positions will be revealed, your names will be affirmed, your ranks will be raised, and your remembrances will be recorded in a preserved tablet. Do not let what is on earth prevent you from this exalted, high station. We have advised you about this in many tablets and in this tablet, which has illuminated from its horizon the radiant laws of your capable, wise Lord.

## Turn Towards Whom God Wills

121 When the sea of union storms and the decree of the origin is fulfilled in the ultimate destiny, turn towards whom God wills, the one who has branched out from this ancient root.

## True Freedom

122 Consider people and the scarcity of their wisdom; they seek what harms them and abandon what benefits them. Indeed, they are among those who wander in ignorance. We see some people who desire freedom and take pride in it; those are in clear ignorance.

123 Indeed, the outcomes of freedom lead to a strife whose fire does not extinguish. This is what the all-knowing Recorder informs you. Know then that the realms and manifestations of freedom belong to the animal world. For humans, it is appropriate to be under laws that protect them from their own ignorance and the harm of deceivers. Freedom takes people away from matters of manners and dignity and makes them among the most contemptible.

124 Observe creation, like sheep they must have a shepherd to guard them. This is a certain truth. We verify this in some situations over others, indeed we are all-knowing.

125 Say, freedom is in obeying My commands if you are among those who know. If people followed what We have revealed to them from the heavens of revelation, they would surely find themselves in pure freedom. Blessed is the one who understands the will of God in what He has revealed from the heavens of His sovereign will over all worlds. Say, the freedom that benefits you is truly in servitude to God the Truth. And whoever has found its sweetness would not exchange it for the dominion of the King of heavens and earth.

## Ask What Benefits You

126 It is forbidden for you to ask about the explanation. God has forgiven this so that you may ask what you need for yourselves, not what men before you have discussed. Fear God and be among the righteous. Ask about what benefits you in the matter of God and His authority. Indeed, the door of grace has been opened to all who are in the heavens and the earth.

## Nineteen Month Calendar

127 Indeed, the number of months is nineteen months in the book of God. Its beginning has been adorned with this supreme name over all the worlds.

## Burial of the Deceased

128 God has decreed the burial of the deceased in crystal, impenetrable stones, or fine, solid woods, and the placement of engraved seals on their fingers. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

129 For men and God belong all that is in the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and God is All-Knowing of all things. For the leaves and God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and God is over all things competent. This is what has been revealed before, and the Point of Explanation calls out and says, "O Beloved of places, speak in this position with what emanates from your tender breezes among the worlds. Indeed, we have informed all that a single word from you cannot be matched with what has been revealed in the explanation. Indeed, you are capable of what you will. Do not prevent your servants from the outpourings of your mercy's sea. Indeed, you are the One with the immense grace." We have responded to what He wants. Indeed, He is the Beloved, the Responsive.

If they inscribe on them what is revealed at the moment from God, indeed it is better for them. Indeed, we were the Judges. It has begun from God and returned to Him, cut off from other than Him, and clinging to His name, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Thus, God selects whom He wills with His grace. Indeed, He is the Capable, the Powerful.

130 And if you shroud them in five garments of silk or cotton, for those who cannot, they should suffice with one of them. Thus, the matter is decreed from the All-Knowing, the Well-Acquainted. It is forbidden for you to transport the deceased more than a distance of one hour from the city. Bury them with spirit and fragrance in a nearby place.

## Relationship with the Bayan

131 God has revoked what the Bayan decreed regarding travel restrictions. Indeed, He is the Chosen One, who does as He pleases and ordains as He wishes.

132 O assembly of creation, listen to the call of the Master of names. He is calling you from the midst of His Great Prison. Indeed, there is no god but Him, the Powerful, the Arrogant, the Dominant, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the Wise. There is no god but He, the Powerful over all the worlds. If He wishes, He can seize the world with a single word from Him. Beware not to hesitate in this matter, to which the highest assembly and the people of the cities of names have submitted. Fear God, and be not among those who veil themselves.

Burn away the veils with the fire of My love and glorify with this name by which We have subjected the worlds.

## Raise the Two Houses

133 And indeed, raise the two houses in the two positions and the positions in which the throne of your merciful Lord has settled. Thus, the Master of the Knowing commands you.

## Be Manifestations of Righteousness

134 Beware that the affairs of the world do not prevent you from what you have been commanded by the Strong, the Trustworthy. Be manifestations of righteousness among creation, so that the doubts of those who disbelieve in God, when He appeared with a great authority, do not hinder you. Beware that what has been revealed in the Book does not prevent you from this Book that speaks the truth. "Indeed, there is no god but I, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy."

Look with the eye of fairness at the one who has come from the sky of Will and Power, and do not be among the wrongdoers.

135 Then remember what has transpired from my promising pen in the mention of this manifestation, and what the tyrants have committed during its days. Indeed, they are the losers. He said, if you perceive what we have manifested, you are from the grace of God, asking Him to bestow His grace upon you by establishing His presence within your inner realities. For indeed, that is a grandeur that is inaccessible and impervious. To drink a cup of water in your presence is greater than for every soul to drink the water of His existence. Indeed, everything, if you only understood, O my servants!

136 This is what has been revealed from Him as a remembrance for myself, if only you knew. And the one who contemplates these verses and delves into what has been hidden within them from the treasured mysteries, by God, they will find the recognition of the Merciful from within the prison, and their heart will rush towards Him with longing that no forces of the heavens and the earth could prevent. Say, this is a manifestation around which the proofs and evidences orbit. Thus has the Merciful revealed it if you are among those who are fair. Say, this is the spirit of the scriptures that has been blown into the supreme pen, and everyone in creation was struck except for those who were touched by the breezes of My mercy and the fragrances of My beneficence, who is sovereign over all the worlds.

## The Direction of Prayer

137 O people of the Bayan, fear the Merciful and then look at what He has revealed in another place. He said: "The Qibla (direction of prayer) is only what God makes it manifest; when it turns, you turn, until it settles down." Thus has it been revealed from the Possessor of Power when He intended to mention this greatest spectacle. Reflect, O people, and do not be among those who wander astray. If you deny this due to your own whims, towards which verse or direction will you turn, O assembly of the heedless? Reflect upon this verse, then be fair for the sake of God. Perhaps you will find the mysteries hidden in the ocean that surged with My Powerful, Invincible Name.

## Do Not Cling to Verses of Prior Manifestations

138 Today, no one should cling to anything other than what has appeared in this manifestation. This is the judgment of God, before and after, and with it the scrolls of the predecessors were adorned. This is the remembrance of God, before and after, with which the brocade of the book of existence has been embellished, if you are among those who perceive. This is the command of God, before and after, beware lest you be among the abased. Nothing can benefit you today, and no one has any refuge except God, the All-Knowing, the Wise. Whoever recognizes Me has recognized the Purpose. Whoever turns towards Me has turned towards the Beloved. Thus has it been detailed in the Book, and the matter has been decreed from God, Lord of the worlds. Whoever reads a verse from My verses, it is better for him than to read the books of the former and the latter. This is the statement of the Merciful, if you are among the listeners.

Say: This is the truth of knowledge, if you are among those who understand.

## Union With Another Should Elevate the Command of God

139 Then, consider what has been revealed in another status, hoping that you might invoke what you possess, turning towards Allah, the Lord of the worlds. It was stated that it is not permissible for a union unless it is explicitly stipulated in the statement. If one party enters into the union, it becomes forbidden for the other party to exercise what they possess from their end unless that is reverted after a command has been elevated from what we have made apparent in truth, or what has appeared justly. Before that happens, you should strive to approach it, hoping that by doing so, you elevate the command of Allah. Thus, the leaves rustled on the branches, mentioning their Merciful Lord. Blessed are those who listen.

## Why God Changes the Laws

140 O assembly of the statements, I swear you by your Lord, the Merciful, to look at what has been revealed in truth with an eye of fairness and not to be among those who see the evidence of God and deny it. Indeed, they are the ones who are ruined. The point of the statement has been clearly articulated in this verse by the elevation of my command before his command. Every fair and knowledgeable person bears witness to that. As you see it today, it has risen to a status that is only denied by those whose vision has been blurred in the past and in the future. For them, there is a humiliating punishment.

141 Say, "By Allah, indeed I am beloved, and now listen to what descends from the heavens of revelation and lament for what you have committed in its days. Fear Allah, and do not be among the transgressors.

Say, 'O people, if you do not believe in it, do not oppose it. By Allah, what has gathered against it from the armies of the oppressors is sufficient."

142 Indeed, some rules have been revealed so that the Supreme Pen may not move in this revelation except to mention His lofty stations and His most beautiful view. When We wanted to show favor, We detailed it with the truth and lightened what We intended for you. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the Noble.

143 I have informed you before about what this Wise Reminder speaks. It says, the truthful word, "that it speaks in every matter that 'there is no god but Me, the Unique, the Singular, the Knowledgeable, the Aware.'"

This is a station that God has specifically assigned to this inaccessible, wondrous revelation. This is from the grace of God if you are among those who understand. This is from His definitive command, His greatest name, His highest word, and the rise of His most beautiful names if you are among the knowledgeable ones. Indeed, with it, the sunrises and the easts become visible. Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed with truth, and contemplate on it, and do not be among the transgressors.

## Live Harmoniously With All Religions

144 Live harmoniously with all religions in a spirit of peace and goodwill, so that they may find in you a reflection of the Most Merciful. Beware that the fervor of ignorance does not take hold of you amongst the innocent. Every beginning is from God, and to Him it will return. Indeed, He is the Initiator of creation and the return of all worlds.

## Do Not Trespass In a House

145 Do not enter a house if its owner is absent, except with his permission. Always adhere to what is known to be right in all circumstances, and do not be among the heedless.

## Purify Wealth and Almsgiving

146 It has been decreed upon you to purify your wealth and everything below it through almsgiving (Zakat). This is the ruling that has been given from the Revealer of Verses in this formidable scripture. We will elaborate its specific amount for you if God wills and intends. Indeed, He details what He wills with knowledge from Him, for He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.

## Do Not Ask For Donations

147 Asking for donations is not permissible, and if someone does ask, it is forbidden for them to receive. It has been decreed for everyone to earn, and those who are incapable, it is for the trustees and the wealthy to provide what is sufficient for them. Follow God's limits and His traditions, then guard them as you would guard your own eyes. And do not be among the losers.

## Do Not Sadden Hearts and Souls

148 You are forbidden in the scripture from arguing, disputing, hitting, and similar actions that sadden the hearts and souls. If anyone causes sorrow to another, they must compensate with nineteen weights of gold. This is the ruling of the Master of the worlds. He has pardoned you in this appearance (revelation) and advises you to righteousness and piety, an order from Him in this enlightening tablet. Do not wish for anyone what you would not wish for yourself. Fear God and do not be among the arrogant. All of you were created from water and will return to the soil. Reflect on your consequences and do not be among the wrongdoers.

Listen to what the lote tree recites to you from the verses of God. Indeed, it is a criterion of guidance from God, the Lord of the hereafter and the first \[life\]. By it, souls fly to the source of revelation and the hearts of those facing \[God\] are illuminated. These are the boundaries of God, which are imposed on you. These are the orders of God, you are commanded to abide by them in the tablet. Act with spirit and fragrance; this is better for you if you are among those who understand.

## Recite the Verses of God Every Morning and Evening

149 Recite the verses of God every morning and evening. Indeed, he who does not recite does not fulfill the covenant of God and His pledge. And he who turns away from it today is indeed among those who turned away from God in the beginning of beginnings. Fear God, O my servants, all of you together.

Do not let the abundance of reading and deeds in the night and day deceive you. If one recites a verse from the verses with spirit and fragrance, it is better for him than to recite with laziness the scriptures of God, the Guardian, the Sustainer. Recite the verses of God to your capacity. Do not let laziness and sadness overcome you. Do not burden the souls with what makes them lethargic and heavy, but lighten them so that they may fly with the wings of the verses to the source of clarity. This is closer to God, if you understand.

## Teach Offspring to Read the Tablets in the Best of Melodies

150 Teach your offspring what has been revealed from the sky of majesty and power, so that they may read the tablets of the Merciful in the best of melodies in the built chambers in the east of remembrances.

Indeed, he who is pulled by the attraction of love to my name, the Merciful, indeed, he recites the verses of God in such a way that it attracts the hearts of the sleeping ones. Blessed is he who drinks the nectar of life from the statement of his Lord, the Merciful, by this name that has blown away every shining, elevated mountain.

## Renew Foundations of the House Every Nineteen Years

151 It has been decreed upon you to renew the foundations of the house after the lapse of nineteen years. Thus, the matter has been decided by the all-knowing, all-aware one. He wished to make things easier for you and what you possess. Be mindful of God and do not be among the heedless. And for the one who is not able, God has pardoned him. Indeed, He is the most forgiving, the most generous.

## Wash Your Feet

152 Wash your feet every day in the summer, and during the winter, once every three days.

## Respond to Anger With Gentleness

153 If someone is angry with you, respond to them with gentleness. If someone rebukes you, do not rebuke them in return. Leave them to their own devices and place your trust in God, the just avenger, the almighty.

## Prohibited From Ascending Pulpits

154 You are prohibited from ascending to pulpits. If someone wishes to recite the verses of their Lord to you, let them sit on a chair placed on a platform and mention God, their Lord and the Lord of the worlds. God has preferred your seating on platforms and chairs, honoring what you have of love for God and the source of His radiant command.

## Gambling and Opium Forbidden

155 Gambling and opium are forbidden to you. Avoid them, O assembly of creation, and do not be among those who transgress. Beware of using anything that dulls your faculties and harms your bodies. We desire nothing for you but what is beneficial to you. Everything testifies to this if you would but listen.

## Respond to Invitations for Banquets and Gatherings with Joy

156 When you are invited to banquets and gatherings, respond with joy and cheerfulness. Those who fulfill their promises are safe from threats. This is a day in which every wise matter is detailed.

## Secret of Reversal

157 The secret of reversal has been revealed for the symbol of the chief. Blessed is he whom God has supported to acknowledge the six, which have risen with this standing 'Alif'. Surely, he is from the sincere ones. How many devout people have turned away, and how many neglectful ones have turned towards, and said to You, "Praise be to You, O Ultimate Goal of the worlds". Indeed, the matter is in the hands of God, He gives to whom He wills what He wills, and He withholds from whom He wills what He wills. He knows what is hidden in the hearts and what the eyes of the scrutinizers move towards.

How many heedless ones have sincerely turned towards us, we have seated them on the bed of acceptance, and how many wise ones we have returned to the fire, as a matter of justice from us, indeed we have been judges. Surely, He is the Manifest, God does what He wills, and the One established on the throne rules as He wishes.

## The Knowledge of Meanings

158 Blessed is he who has found the knowledge of meanings from the trace of this pen, which when moves, the breath of God is spread in what is beyond it, and when it stops, the essence of tranquility appears in the places. Exalted is the Most Merciful, the manifestor of this great favor. Say: with what the darkness carried, the back of justice appeared in what is beyond it, and with what accepted the humiliation, the honor of God shone between the worlds.

## Carrying Weapons of War, Adorn Yourself with Manners and Ethics

159 It is forbidden for you to carry weapons of war except in times of necessity, and it is permissible for you to wear silk. God has lifted from you the rule of limitation in dress and beard, as a favor from Him. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing Commander. Do what is not condemned by upright minds, and do not make yourselves a playground for the ignorant. Blessed is the one who adorns himself with the embroidery of manners and ethics, indeed he is among those who supported his Lord with clear and manifest deeds.

## Melodies in the Houses of God

160 Construct the houses of God and His lands, then remember Him therein with the melodies of those drawn near. Indeed, hearts are built by the tongue, just as houses and dwellings are built by hand and other means. We have predetermined a cause for everything from Us. Hold on to it and rely on the Wise, the All-Knowing.

## The Foundation of Beliefs

161 Blessed is the one who affirms God and His signs and acknowledges that He is not questioned about what He does. This word, God has made it the foundation of beliefs and its root, and by it, the work of the workers is accepted. Make this word before your eyes so that the signs of those who turn away do not cause you to stumble.

162 If what was forbidden from time immemorial becomes lawful, or vice versa, no one has the right to object to it. And he who stops at anything less than this, indeed, he is among the transgressors.

163 And he who has not attained this supreme foundation and the highest station is swayed by the winds of doubt and is turned about by the sayings of the idolaters. He who attains this foundation has indeed achieved the greatest rectitude. How excellent is this most glorious station which, by its mention, adorns every impregnable tablet.

Thus, Allah teaches you what delivers you from doubt and confusion and saves you in this world and the hereafter. Indeed, He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Generous. He is the one who sent the messengers and revealed the books, asserting that there is no deity except Him, the Mighty, the Wise.

## To the Land of Kaf and Ra

164 O land of Kaf and Ra, indeed we see you in a state which Allah does not love, and we observe from you what no one else perceives except Allah, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware. And we find what flows from you in the secret of secrets, in our possession is the knowledge of all things in a clear tablet. Do not grieve over this, for Allah will soon make manifest in you champions of great might who remember Me steadfastly, not deterred by the signs of the scholars nor obscured by the doubts of the suspicious ones.

These are the ones who gaze upon Allah with their own eyes and support Him with their very selves. Verily, they are those firmly grounded in truth.

## To the Community of Scholars

### Do Not Cause Corruption

165 O community of scholars, when the verses were revealed and the clear proofs appeared, we saw you behind the veils. This is indeed a matter of wonder. You have taken pride in My name and neglected My essence. When the Merciful came with the argument and the proof, We broke through the veils. Beware of veiling the people with another veil. Break the chains of illusions in the name of the Sovereign of Mankind and do not be among the deceivers. When you turn towards Allah and enter this matter, do not cause corruption therein, nor measure Allah's book by your desires. This is the advice of Allah before and after. The witnesses of Allah and His chosen ones bear witness to this. Verily, we all are witnesses to it.

166 Remember the elder who was named Muhammad, before Hassan, and he was among the most knowledgeable scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and his likes turned away from it, and those who separated the wheat from the barley turned to Allah. He, on his claim, wrote down the laws of Allah night and day. But when the Chosen One came, not a letter of it benefited him. If it had benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face which illuminated the faces of the close ones. If you had believed in Allah at the time of His manifestation, people would not have turned away from Him and what you see happening today would not have been reported to us. Fear Allah and do not be among the heedless.

### Do Not Let Names Deter You From Their Owner

167 Beware that you do not let names deter you from their Owner, or let remembrance obscure this Wise Remembrance. Seek refuge in Allah, O assembly of scholars, and do not make yourselves a veil between me and my creation. Thus, Allah admonishes you and commands you to be just, lest your deeds become void while you are unaware. The one who turned away from this matter, can he affirm a truth in innovation? No, for he is the Master of invention, but people are in a clear veil. Say, with this, the sun of the proof has risen, and the light of the evidence has appeared to those in the realm. Fear Allah, O people of insight, and do not deny. Beware lest the mention of the Prophet prevent you from this Greater News, or the guardianship prevent the Guardianship of Allah, the Protector over all the worlds.

Every name has been created by His word, and every matter is tied to His command, the Executor, the Mighty, the Innovator. Say, this is the Day of Allah, in which only His Dominant Self is mentioned over all the worlds. This matter has disturbed what you have of illusions and images.

### Don't Use the Book and Use it as Evidence Against Allah

168 We see among you those who take the book and use it as evidence against Allah, just as every community used its book as evidence against Allah, the Dominant, the Sustainer. Say, by Allah, the truth is that today, the books of the world and what they contain of scriptures will not benefit you, except for this book which speaks at the axis of creation, affirming that there is no god but I, the All-Knowing, the Wise.

### Unite People

169 O assembly of scholars, beware of becoming the cause of disagreement among the masses, just as you were the reason for their turning away at the beginning. Unite the people around this statement by which the pebbles proclaimed 'the Kingdom belongs to Allah, the source of the signs'. Thus Allah advises you out of His grace. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous.

170 Remember the noble one whom we invited to Allah. Indeed, he was arrogant, following his whims after we sent him the proof that pleased the eye. Thus, Allah's argument was completed upon everyone in the heavens and the earths. We commanded him to approach with grace from the Rich, the Exalted, but he turned his back until the punishers of torment seized him, by Allah's justice. Indeed, we were witnesses.

171 We tore apart the veils so that the inhabitants of the kingdom might hear the sound of their tearing. This is the command of Allah from before and hereafter. Blessed are those who act upon what is commanded, and woe to the neglectful.

172 We only intended in the realm of sovereignty to manifest God and His authority, and God is sufficient as a witness over me. We only intended in the celestial sphere to elevate the command of God and His praise, and God is sufficient as my guardian. We only intended in the realm of omnipotence to mention God and what descended from Him, and God is sufficient as my helper.

## Blessings for the Assembly of Scholars in Splendor

173 Blessed are you, O assembly of scholars, in splendor! By God, you are the waves of the greatest sea, the stars of the sky of grace, and the banners of victory between the heavens and the earth. You are the sources of rectitude among creation and the dawns of clarity for all those who can comprehend. Blessed is the one who turns towards you, and woe to those who turn away. Today, it is fitting for the one who has drunk the nectar of life from the hand of his most kind and merciful Lord to become as vital as the artery in the body of existence, so that the world may be stirred by him and every decayed bone reanimated.

## Return What You Did Not Understand To the Branch

174 O people of creation, when the leaves flutter away from the tree of praise, and head towards the most remote and hidden destination, return what you did not understand from the Book to the branch that branches out from this upright origin.

## The Supreme Pen Moves Only By Permission From the Lord

175 O Supreme Pen, move across the Tablet by the permission of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Then remember when the source of monotheism, the office of abstraction, was desired. Perhaps the free will glimpse the capacity of the needle's syringe with what is behind the curtains of your Lord's secrets, the Mighty, the All-Knowing. Say, indeed, we entered the office of meanings and clarification when those in existence were unaware. We witnessed what the Merciful descended and accepted what He gifted to me from the signs of God, the Guardian, the Everlasting. We heard what He testified in the Tablet. Indeed, we were witnesses. We fulfilled it by a command from us. Indeed, we were commanders.

## To the Eloquent Assembly (People of the Bayan)

176 O eloquent assembly, indeed, we entered the office of God when you were asleep, and we observed the Tablet when you were slumbering. By God, the truth, we read it before its descent while you were unaware. We comprehended the book when you were in the loins. This is my remembrance according to your measure, not according to God's measure. What is in God's knowledge testifies to this if you but knew, and the tongue of God testifies to this if you but understood. By God, if the veil were lifted, you would be struck dumb.

### Beware Arguing About God

177 Beware of arguing about God and His command. He has become apparent in such a manner that He encompasses what has been and what will be. If we speak in this place with the tongue of the celestial beings, we would say, God created that office before the creation of the heavens and the earth, and we entered it before the letter "kaf" was combined with its cornerstone, the "nun" \[Arabic letters\].

This is the language of my servants in my kingdom. Reflect on what the tongue of the beings of my dominion speaks, with the knowledge we have taught them from Us, and what was hidden in the knowledge of God, and what the tongue of greatness and power speaks in its praiseworthy position.

178 This is not a matter to play with your illusions, and this is not a place where every coward and deluded one can enter. By God, this is a track of disclosure and detachment, and a field of observation and elevation. Only the knights of the Merciful, who have discarded their capabilities, can wander here. They are the supporters of God on earth and the sources of power among all the worlds.

### Beware Allowing What is in the Explanation from Preventing You from you Lord

179 Beware of allowing what is in the explanation to prevent you from your Merciful Lord. By God, it was indeed sent down for my remembrance if you only knew. The sincere ones find in it nothing but the recognition of my love and my name, the Supreme Witness over all things seen and unseen. Say, O people, turn your attention to what was sent down from my highest pen. If you find in it the knowledge of God, do not object to it and do not prevent yourselves from God's bounty and His subtleties. Thus, God advises you, for He is indeed the Wise Advisor.

### Ask God What You Do Not Understand

180 What you do not understand from the explanation, ask God, your Lord, and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Indeed, if He wills, He can clarify for you what was sent down in it and what was hidden in the sea of His words from the precious jewels of knowledge and wisdom. Indeed, He is the Supreme Authority over the names. There is no god but He, the Supreme Authority, the Sustainer.

## This Greatest Composition

181 This greatest composition has stirred up the rhythm, and this marvelous order, which no eye of creativity has witnessed its likeness, has brought about a change in the arrangement.

## The Religion of God, Before and After

182 Immerse yourselves in the ocean of my explanations, perhaps you will uncover from it the pearls of wisdom and mysteries. Beware that you do not hesitate in this matter, through which the sovereignty and power of God have appeared. Hasten to it with bright faces. This is the religion of God, before and after. Whoever desires, let him accept, and whoever does not, indeed, God is free from need of the worlds.

183 Say: This is the balance of guidance for those in the heavens and the earth, and the greatest proof if you but knew. Say: With it, every argument is established in the ages if you but have certainty.

## To You Who Turns Away (Mirza Yahya)

184 Say, O you who turns away, leave your preoccupations, then speak the truth among creation. By God, my tears have flowed on my cheeks for seeing you turning towards your whims and turning away from the One who created you and fashioned you. Remember the favor of your Lord when He nurtured you through nights and days for the sake of His cause. Fear God and be among those who repent. Has your matter become unclear to people, is it unclear to yourself as well? Hide from God, then remember when you were standing before the Throne and you wrote what We revealed to you from the signs of God, the Dominant, the Able, the Powerful.

### Turn to Him and He Will Forgive You

Beware that your passion doesn't prevent you from acknowledging the unity of God. Turn to Him and do not fear your actions, for He forgives whomever He wills out of His grace. There is no god but He, the Forgiving, the Generous. We only advise you for the sake of God. If you accept, it's for your own benefit, and if you turn away, indeed, your Lord is free from need of you and those who follow you out of clear delusion. God has taken from those who led you astray, so return to Him humbly, submissively, and with utter humility. Indeed, He will erase your misdeeds. Indeed, your Lord is the Repentant, the Mighty, the Merciful.

## The Advice, Grace, and Remembrance of God

185 This is the advice of God, if you are among those who listen. This is the grace of God, if you are among those who accept. This is the remembrance of God, if you are among those who perceive. This is the treasure of God, if you are among those who know.

## This Book Has Become The Lamp For the World

186 This is a book that has become the lamp for the world's path and its straightest way among the worlds. Say, indeed, it is the source of God's knowledge if you know, and the sunrise of God's commands if you understand.

## Do Not Burden Animals With What They Cannot Bear

187 Do not burden the animals with what they cannot bear. We have strictly forbidden you from this in the Book. Be the embodiments of justice and fairness between the heavens and the earths.

## Penalty For Unintentionally Killing a Person

188 Whoever kills a person unintentionally, there is an indemnity for it to be paid to his family, and it is a hundred weights of gold. Act according to what you have been commanded in the Tablet, and do not be among the transgressors.

## To People of the Councils In the Lands

### Choose a Language and Script, a Cause of Unity

189 O people of the councils in the lands, choose a language from the languages to be spoken on earth and so too from the scripts. Indeed, God clarifies for you what benefits you and makes you self-sufficient from others. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the All-Knowing, the Well-Informed. This is the cause of unity if you know, and the major reason for agreement and civilization if you feel. We have made these two matters as signs for reaching the first world, which is the greatest foundation. We revealed it in other tablets, and the second one was revealed in this extraordinary tablet.

## Consumption of Opium is Forbidden

190 The consumption of opium has been made forbidden to you. We have emphatically prohibited it in the Scripture. Whoever consumes it, verily, they are not from Me. Be mindful of God, O people of understanding.
