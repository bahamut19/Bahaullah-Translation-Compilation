# BH10203 {#sec-bh10203 .unnumbered}

Be with those of fire, but not with those who feign.

Be an infidel, but not deceitful.

Reside in the tavern, but do not go into lanes of pretense.

Fear God, but do not fear the clergy.

Give your head, but do not give your heart.

Rest under a stone, but do not seek shelter in the shade of deceit.

This is the melody of the holy reed and the songs of the heavenly nightingale, which bestows life upon mortal bodies, gives a spiritual essence to earthly forms, grants divine light, and, with a single letter, draws the temporal world to the eternal kingdom.
