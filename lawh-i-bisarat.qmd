## The Thirteenth Good News

23 Indeed, the affairs of the community are entrusted to the men of the Divine House of Justice. They are the trustees of God among His servants and the sources of command in His countries.

24 O Party of God, indeed, the Educator of the world is Justice, for it encompasses both punishment and reward. These two pillars are the sources of life for the people of the world. And since every day demands a matter and every moment calls for a decision, therefore, matters are referred to the ministers of the House of Justice to determine what they see is appropriate for the requirements of the time. Those who serve the cause for the sake of God, they are inspired by divine, unseen inspirations and everyone is obligated to obey them. All political matters are referred to the House of Justice. As for acts of worship, they refer to what God has revealed in the Book.

25 You are the dawns of the love of God and the sources of His care. So do not defile your tongues by cursing or condemning anyone. Lower your gaze from what is not appropriate for it. Show people what you have, if it is accepted then that's good, otherwise, imposing is not permissible. Leave it to itself, turning to God, the Guardian, the Everlasting. And do not be a cause for anyone's grief, let alone corruption and dispute. Hopefully, you are raised under the shade of the divine care tree and work with what God wanted. All of you are the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean.
