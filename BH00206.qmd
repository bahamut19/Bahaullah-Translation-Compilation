# BH00206 (Letters to Isfahan) {#sec-bh00206 .unnumbered}

In the name of our Most Sacred, Most Great, Most Ancient, Most High, and Most Glorious Lord.

1 Blessed is the Lord who speaks upon the Throne, through whose Name the Standard has been raised upon the Mount of the hearts of the near ones, proclaiming that there is no God but He, and the Banner unfurled over the highest station of the hearts of the seekers, proclaiming that He is the Unique, the All-Knowing. Blessed is He through whom the Pen of the Most High has been set into motion in the Kingdom of creation, causing the ocean of knowledge to surge, the Sun of Manifestation to shine forth, the birds to sing, the Supreme Concourse to call out, and all things to speak.

2 By God! The world has been adorned with the appearance of the Hidden Mystery, the treasured secret, the preserved symbol, who has appeared with the Most Great Name among the nations. Rejoice, O inhabitants of the City of Names and O dwellers of the Pavilion of Grandeur, at what is uttered by the Speaker of the Mount in the Greatest Vision, the station honored by the presence of the Lord of Destiny, through whom the eyes of the near ones are comforted.

3 The near ones are gladdened, while the limbs of the disbelievers tremble. Through Him, the faces of the monotheists are illumined, and every face that turns away from the Dawning-Place of Revelation on this Manifest Day is darkened. Exalted is He who spoke the Supreme Word and caused all things to speak it: "There is no God but Him." Through it, the Hour has appeared, the recognition of which was veiled from every sage and monotheist. Whoever sought to recognize it was warned by the Tongue of Grandeur, saying, "What concern have you with its mention?"

4 Blessings, peace, glorification, and splendor rest upon those who were not deterred by the mockery of enemies from turning to God, the Master of Names, nor intimidated by the hosts of creation in this Cause, which has caused the hearts of the learned, mystics, poets, and rulers to quake. These are noble servants, attested by the Tongue of God, the All-Powerful, over what has been and what will be.

5 Glorified are You, O God of the world and Desire of the nations. You see and know that when this servant seeks to mention Your pure ones and loved ones, he is overcome by such agitation that his being trembles, and every vein of his body stirs. For one who has no mention or station, how can he describe those who have offered their lives in Your path and hastened to the abode of sacrifice in Your Name? I bear witness that they are servants sanctified from attributes other than Yours and from all mentions besides Yours. Your Supreme Pen, by which all things were created with but a single motion, has celebrated their remembrance in the arena of praise. I beseech You, O You in whose absence hearts melt and servants cry out, to grant this servant what You have ordained for them, through Your bounty, without deserving it. Verily, O Lord, You are the Generous, and I am the supplicant at Your door. Do not disappoint me by Your grace and gifts. You are the All-Powerful, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

6 This servant has attained Your Book, which, when its seal was broken and Your cry of love and yearning for God, our Beloved and Yours, echoed forth, the Sovereign of the worlds was praised. By Your life, Beloved! I have read what You uttered in communion with the Lord of Eternity and the Sovereign of nations. I wept for Your separation and was consumed by the fire of Your love. As Your fire ignited within me, I turned towards the realm of reunion until I stood before the face of our Exalted and Independent Lord. There, the face of God turned to me and asked about what was in my hand. I opened it and presented its contents, which were filled with the remembrance and praise of God. When it concluded, the Kingdom of Revelation stirred, and the Tongue of the Merciful proclaimed:

7 "O \`Alí Qabl-i-Akbar, hear the cry of the Oppressed One and rise to serve this Cause with steadfastness, a steadfastness sanctified from the affairs of the world. Remain ever under the canopy of God’s favor, as you are mentioned in the Book of God. Strive to carry out deeds that will elevate the Cause of God and unite hearts. Whosoever humbles themselves before God, God will exalt in truth. By the Sun of Divine Love, which shines from the horizons of the hearts of the pure, I swear: if a soul performs a deed for the sake of God, that deed will appear as a morning star rising in the heavens of divine knowledge."

8 Hearken with the ear of the spirit to the Pen of the Most High and arise to perform that which will uplift and exalt the Cause of God. Thereafter, witness its fruits. Thus does the All-Knowing inform you, and the All-Wise instruct you. Rest assured in the shadow of divine grace, and God willing, you will remain so. Strive that no stranger may find an opportunity for rejection or opposition. Let the lamp of love and success be lit between the righteous by the flame of wisdom. Act in accordance with what We have commanded you earlier and in this Tablet, that you may witness the grace of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Generous, your Lord who is the All-Encompassing, the All-Knowing.

9 Be focused on the horizon of My Cause and act in ways that merit My good pleasure, so that the fragrance of My acceptance may be diffused therefrom. Thus commands you the Manifestation of My Glory from His exalted and mighty station.

10 Be vigilant concerning the Cause of God under all circumstances. Some individuals, driven by selfish desires, have caused and continue to cause discord, using the Cause of God as a pretext. They act according to their desires and attribute them to God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. How much blood has been shed in this path, and how many heads have been raised upon spears in this wondrous Cause!

11 Say, O people: Be just for the sake of God and do not commit that which would harm the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Great. Stand firm with utmost steadfastness and speak with the utmost joy and gladness, that some may become mindful and turn away from their own desires, returning to the Sovereign of the Throne and earth. Verily, He knows and is aware, and He is the Concealer, the Wise.

12 O \`Alí Qabl-i-Akbar, most are heedless and intoxicated with the desires of the self. Such souls are prevented from approaching the One True God. Beseech God, your Lord, that He may guide them to the Straight Path and assist them in what is fitting for the Days of God, the Lord of all worlds.

13 Know that the servant who stood before the Throne presented what was uttered by Your Tongue, which is the praise and remembrance of God. We have heard it as a bounty from Us, and We responded with a Tablet that proclaims with the loftiest of calls and guides humanity to the path of God, the Mighty, the Praised.

14 Say, O people: Answer the call of God among you and do not follow those who confess with their words but deny Him in their actions. Your Lord is indeed the Witness and the All-Hearing.

15 God willing, you will be enabled to perform deeds that awaken, guide, and purify humanity, bringing them nearer to holiness and sanctity. Rejoice in this remembrance and say: "Praise be to You, O Beloved of the world! All thanks are Yours, O Desire of the nations. I beseech You to strengthen me in Your remembrance and in serving Your Cause in such a manner that I am not hindered by what is seen or unseen in Your dominion. O Lord, purify me with what makes me wholly devoted to Your love, a supporter of Your Cause, and detached from all else but You. You are the Almighty, the Exalted, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed."

16 O \`Alí Qabl-i-Akbar, the Sovereign of Destiny has willed to mention the Land of Ṣád, where the Banner of the Love of God has been raised. Blessed is it and those who turn to it with pure hearts, visiting in it My trust and My treasure. Thus has the Tongue of My grace spoken upon the Tree of My bounty. I am indeed the Bountiful One.

17 O Land of Ṣád, give thanks and rejoice for having been exalted by God to a station that will soon be referred to in all directions. The bounty is in His hands; He grants it to whomever He wills. He is indeed the Almighty, the All-Powerful, and there is no God but Him, the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. Blessed are you and your people who have perceived the fragrance of God’s robe and endured hardship and suffering in His path. By My life, they are among those mentioned by the inhabitants of the Most High Paradise and praised by all who have spoken of truth in the path of God, the Sovereign of all.

18 O people of Ṣád, you are those who abandoned your homelands for the love of the Merciful, while wolves sought to harm you and venomous creatures stirred with hypocrisy and error.

19 O Ḥaydar, We have raised you up, made you known, taught you, and offered you the wine of Our Revelation, which has been sent down by the Merciful in the Qur’án. God has described it in previous Scriptures, Books, and Tablets through the tongues of His chosen ones. When its seal was broken by the Finger of the Almighty, all heedless souls turned away from it, while the sincere ones hastened towards it with radiant faces.

20 Blessed is the Master of Names who has revealed it and chosen it for those who responded to the call of their Lord with humility and submission. You have heard from the enemies that which caused the Supreme Concourse to lament. Listen now to what the Master of Names proclaims in this station, where the sincere ones ever circle in devotion. Thus, pearls of My mercy have been cast to you from the ocean of My grace. Gather them in My name and give thanks to your Lord in the evenings and at dawn.

21 O Ḥasan-i-Qabl-i-‘Alí, your oppression has been witnessed by the dwellers of the highest Paradise and by the sanctified sanctuaries, whose faces are honored above turning towards earthly matters. These are they who dedicate their submission, humility, and utterances wholly to God, the Lord of Lords. The cities of names have mourned your tribulations; the Creator of the heavens has testified to this, the One who has manifested Himself to the world with the Most Great Name. He has spoken words that have caused the mountains to crumble. Reflect on the grace of your Lord and then give thanks with gratitude that stirs hearts and sets souls aloft.

22 The names mentioned in your letter have been presented before the Throne. Unique and mighty verses have been revealed for each from the heaven of the will of the Lord of Oneness.

23 O Ḥasan-i-Qabl-i-‘Alí, all these souls are remembered before the Throne, and their names are inscribed by the manifest Pen in the Book of God. Some of these individuals have received multiple Tablets revealed in their names and sent to them. The Dawning-Place of Revelation and the Source of Scriptures testify to their tribulations in the path of God. The divine Word and the concealed letters of the scrolls bear witness to all they have endured for the love of God. By the life of the Beloved! On the second night of the blessed month of Ramaḍán, a unique utterance has been revealed, recounting the mention of the friends. Were people to grasp even a drop or a particle of the ocean of grace that has been revealed to them, they might perish in rapture.

24 Now it is imperative to strive with all effort to ensure that this Supreme and Most High station does not slip away but remains firm. The fire of heedlessness and disobedience will inevitably consume the saplings of deeds. After the events of the Land of Ṣád, all have been adorned with the robe of forgiveness and remain under the special grace of God. Exalted is His bounty, exalted is His mercy, exalted is His majesty.

25 The Most Great Truth bears witness: should souls reflect even briefly upon the divine favors, they would never be saddened nor find themselves burdened with sorrow. Diversified objects and the trappings of this transient world have become veils, preventing people from beholding the truth. Otherwise, all would turn with utmost joy and detachment towards the horizon of the Creator.

26 The gaze of the Lord of existence is fixed upon the faces of the people of Ṣád, who have cast away the books of conjecture and illusion, holding firmly to what has been revealed by God, the Sovereign of all. To them, He proclaims His greatness and calls them to remembrance, uttering words before which all the tongues of the spirit bow down. Bear tidings to them of My remembrance, mercy, and grace, and convey to them My words.

27 God willing, all the pure ones will arise and act in ways that uplift and exalt the Cause of God. Reflect on which deeds today will lead to the elevation of humanity and the exaltation of the Cause. Disputes and strife have been prohibited in most Tablets. This blessed utterance was revealed long ago from the heaven of the Will of God: the triumph of the Cause of God lies in the sword of wisdom and words, not in the sword of steel. Similar utterances are abundant in the divine verses. God willing, those endowed with insight have seen and understood these truths. Therefore, the people of truth must reflect on how to remove the veils that hinder humanity today and bring about the elevation and sublimity of the Cause of God.

28 O Ḥasan-i-Qabl-i-‘Alí, meditate on what has been revealed by the Pen, and offer your life in the path of truth. This testimony cannot be conveyed fully by pen, tongue, words, or Tablets. The name of Ḥasan stands supreme above all splendor, for he attained this supreme testimony even before his visible martyrdom, having sacrificed all desires, will, and thoughts for the Friend. He offered all his stations in devotion and afterward achieved outward martyrdom, laying down his life in the path of the True Beloved. He cast aside the crown of life and placed it at the feet of the Friend.

29 Blessed is the one who recognizes this station, and blessed is the one who perceives the fragrance of the words of the Merciful. Anyone who truly surrenders themselves to the Truth and becomes annihilated in the path of Truth regards neither their own rank nor station but focuses solely on the Cause of God and that which His wisdom establishes. By the Sun of My Revelation, whoever attains that which My Pen has proclaimed has indeed triumphed in realms beyond imagination. Beware lest anything prevents you from treading the Straight Path. Walk steadfastly on My straight path. Let everyone strive with utmost effort to attain the station of divine contentment. People are heedless and unaware. A true explainer is needed, and if such a one acts in accordance with the command of God, their light will surely illuminate the world and lead the nations to the horizon of eternity.

30 O \`Alí Qabl-i-Akbar, since the triumph of the Cause of God has been sanctified by the Almighty and the Most Glorious from disputes, conflicts, the drawing of swords, and similar actions, it is necessary to cling to the cord of virtuous deeds and spiritual qualities. If a soul performs deeds in accordance with what has been revealed, such deeds will undoubtedly influence the world and tear asunder the veils that obstruct truth. What God has ordained as the means of the victory and exaltation of His Cause is effective and compelling. This is witnessed by every discerning eye.

31 Act with the utmost wisdom under all circumstances, never letting it slip from your grasp. Do not place your trust in every claimant nor believe every speaker. Do not reveal the hidden to everyone who bows in humility. Some individuals may express acceptance with one word and rejection with another. In teaching, speak with words imbued with the warmth of divine love. If the listener becomes enkindled and attains steadfastness, they will gradually comprehend what had been hidden from them. The Supreme Pen has, in varying expressions, outlined the wisdom and ranks of these matters so that all may partake of them and derive benefit.

32 Mírzá Muḥammad-Ḥusayn, as you had written, his case was presented. This is what has been revealed from the Kingdom of the Revelation of our Merciful Lord:

33 He is the Manifest One, risen from the horizon of manifestation, a Book sent down by the Wronged One for those who desire to draw near to the ocean of Revelation during these days. The Merciful has mentioned them in the Qur’án, in the Books of old, and in the Scriptures revealed to the Prophets and Messengers. Let them take the Book with the permission of their Lord and drink from it the Kawthar of Life, which flows from the Finger of the Will of God, the Lord of all worlds. Hear My call and arise with a fervor that the fragrances of the verses of your Lord, the Almighty, the Powerful, may draw you near.

34 Blessed is the father from whom is born one who acknowledges God and His signs, and blessed is the mother who gives birth to one who turns to the Supreme Horizon and believes in the Unique, the All-Knowing. Listen to what the All-Hearing proclaims so that the All-Seeing may show you what delighted the eyes of the Messengers. Waves have surged from the ocean of the Revelation of your Lord, carrying the breezes of divine inspiration over it.

35 Behold this noble station and bear witness to what God testified to before the creation of the heavens and the earth: that there is no God but Him. He speaks, and indeed He is the Desired One in the Scriptures of God and the Promised One spoken of by the near ones. Whoever attains this testimony has indeed been granted the grace of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

36 Regarding Ḥájí Ghulám-Riḍá, as you wrote, lofty words have arisen from the dawning place of the Merciful’s will:

37 He is the One who calls from the Supreme Horizon. Glory be to Him who has manifested and revealed the Cause however He wills! Indeed, He is the All-Powerful over whatsoever He wills. There is no God but Him, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Rejoice in what the Supreme Pen reminds you of, as it is the dawning-place of names in the prison of \`Akká, due to the actions of those who disbelieved in the Hidden Mystery.

38 Reflect upon the world and its people. It bears witness to its own transience in every moment and calls humanity with its loudest voice to the Supreme Station. Yet most people are unaware. Beware lest the affairs of the world veil you from the Truth who proclaims His Most Great Name in the world, inviting all to the Praised Station. We remember those who have turned to the horizon of Revelation in this station, named by the Most Beautiful Names in the Book of God, the Lord of all that was and will be.

39 When you attain My Book and drink from the sealed wine it offers, give thanks and say: "Praise be to You, O One who enabled me to recognize the treasury of Your secrets and the source of Your verses. I bear witness that You are indeed powerful over whatever You will, and the reins of existence are in Your grasp."

40 Regarding the foreigner of Europe you mentioned, it was presented, and it was said: If such souls were to receive the Word and disseminate it in their lands, it would not be problematic. However, if they proclaim it within this land, it could cause corruption. What is given must be accurate. Some copies of the Book of Íqán found in this land are not entirely accurate. The Book recently sent by the Most Great Branch to Zayn al-Muqarrabín, containing the Tablets of the Kings, should be provided. It is preferable after verification. God speaks the truth and provides the evidence and guidance.

41 Regarding Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥasan, as you wrote, this was revealed for him:

He is the Speaker on the Mount.

42 "Be thankful, O Ḥasan, for having witnessed My days, inhaled the fragrance of My grace, turned toward My horizon, heard My call, and drunk the wine of Revelation from the hands of My bounty. By My life, the bounty is for the one who finds, hears, knows, and answers their Lord, through whose appearance the treasured secret and hidden mystery were unveiled, the cry was raised between earth and heaven, and the nightingale warbled upon the branches of the Tree of Names, proclaiming: 'There is no God but I, the Unique, the All-Knowing.'

43 The hearing one is the one who heeds the verses of God, and the seeing one is the one who beholds the Supreme Horizon when the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens appeared with sovereign might. Say: All greatness extols Him from beyond, all exaltation humbles itself before His sovereignty, and all knowledge flees the arena of understanding when the Pen of the Merciful takes to the field. By My life, if you taste the sweetness of Revelation, you would soar into the atmosphere of the Merciful and find yourself in a joy that encompasses the happiness of the world. Thus does the Lord of Eternity remind you with a Revelation sanctified above words and expressions, though it has appeared clothed in them."

44 Reflect on these words and consider the greatness of the Day of God. Rise to serve His Cause, for the testimony of this Day is not bound by pen, speech, writings, or Tablets. The name of Ḥasan is raised above every splendor, for he attained this supreme testimony even before offering his life outwardly. He sacrificed all personal desires, thoughts, and will in the path of the Beloved and devoted his station entirely to the Friend. He then attained visible martyrdom, laying down his life for the True Beloved, casting the crown of life at the feet of the Friend.

45 Blessed is the one who recognizes this station, and blessed is the one who perceives the fragrance of the Word of the Merciful. Anyone who truly surrenders themselves to the Truth and annihilates themselves in the path of Truth will not consider their own rank, status, or reputation but will focus solely on the Cause of God and the wisdom established by Him.

46 By the Sun of My Revelation, whoever attains what My Pen has proclaimed has indeed triumphed in realms beyond imagining. Beware lest anything prevents you from treading the Straight Path. Strive with all effort to attain the station of divine contentment. People are heedless and unaware. A true guide is needed, and if such a one acts in accordance with the command of God, their light will surely illuminate the world and lead nations to the horizon of eternity. Since the triumph of the Cause of God has been sanctified by the Almighty and the Most Glorious from disputes, conflicts, the drawing of swords, and similar actions, it is necessary to cling to the cord of virtuous deeds and spiritual qualities.

47 Should a soul act according to what has been revealed, their deeds will undoubtedly influence the world and tear asunder the veils of doubt. What God has ordained as the means of the victory and exaltation of His Cause is compelling and effective. This is attested by every discerning soul.

48 Act with utmost wisdom and never abandon it under any circumstance. Do not be deceived by every claimant nor believe every speaker. Do not reveal what is hidden to everyone who seems humble. Some may show interest with a word and rejection with another. When teaching, speak with words that radiate the warmth of divine love. If the listener becomes enkindled and attains steadfastness, they will gradually comprehend what had been hidden.

The Supreme Pen has, in varying expressions, outlined the wisdom and purpose of these matters so that all may partake of them. Reflect deeply on what has been revealed and strive to act in accordance with it, for therein lies the exaltation of the Cause of God.
