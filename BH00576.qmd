[^bh00576-1]: Jamál Burújirdí was a trusted teacher during the time of Baha'u'llah. This tablet might be incomplete due to the Baha'i Faith treating him as a Covenant Breaker.

### Excerpt 1:

1 God, exalted be He, has said in a Tablet revealed for Jamál Burújirdí:\
“The heaven of divine wisdom is clear, luminous, and radiant with consultation and compassion in all matters. Hold fast to consultation, for it is the lamp of guidance, directing the way and granting understanding. Thus does the All-Knowing, the All-Wise inform you.”

### Excerpt 2:

2 O assembly of humanity! Hold fast to the firm cord; it is beneficial for you on earth from God, the Lord of the worlds. Take justice and equity, and abandon that which every ignorant, remote one has commanded you—those who adorned their heads with turbans and issued verdicts against the One through whom every wise matter was made manifest. In My name, they elevated their stations among the servants, yet when I revealed Myself, they unjustly condemned Me. Thus has the Pen spoken the truth, and yet the people remain heedless.

3 Verily, whoever adheres to justice does not exceed the bounds of moderation in any matter and possesses insight granted by the All-Seeing. Civilization, as described by the learned of Egypt in terms of industries and excellence, if it exceeds the bounds of moderation, becomes a calamity for the people. Thus does the All-Knowing inform you: its excess becomes the source of corruption, even as its balance was the source of reform. Reflect, O people, and do not wander aimlessly. The cities will burn with its fire, and the tongue of majesty will proclaim: Sovereignty belongs to God, the Mighty, the Praised.

4 Likewise, observe everything in creation, and then thank your Lord for what He has reminded you of in this wondrous Tablet. Praise be to God, the Sovereign of the Great Throne.

5 If a soul truly reflects on what has been revealed from the Supreme Pen and tastes its sweetness, they will undoubtedly become free from their own will and desire and move in accordance with God’s will. Blessed is the soul that attains this station and is not deprived of this supreme bounty. Today, neither the hidden and unknown beloved nor the manifestly renowned is desired. One must act with wisdom and remain occupied in the service of the Cause.

6 It is incumbent upon all to reflect on the conditions of this Wronged One. From the beginning of the Cause until now, We have been visible among both friends and foes. Even at times when tribulations and calamities encompassed Us from all sides, We, with perfect power, summoned the people of the earth to the Most Exalted Horizon. The Supreme Pen has never, nor does it now, desire to recount Our sufferings, for surely such an account would grieve the near ones, the unifiers, and the sincere. Verily, He is the One who speaks, hears, and knows. For most of these days, We were in the hands of enemies, and now We dwell among serpents.

7 These sacred lands are described and mentioned in all the divine books. Most of the prophets and messengers have appeared from these lands. This is the desert in which all the messengers proclaimed, "Here I am, O God, here I am!" and in which the promise of the appearance of God was to be fulfilled. This is the Valley of Decree, the White Land, the Spot of Radiance, as mentioned in previous scriptures. Yet, the people of this land have been rejected in all the divine books to such a degree that, in some contexts, they have been likened to the offspring of vipers. And now this Wronged One cries out with the most exalted call among the offspring of vipers, summoning all to the ultimate goal, the loftiest peak, and the Most Exalted Horizon. Blessed is the one who hears what the tongue has proclaimed in the Kingdom of Utterance, and woe unto every heedless, distant one.
