# **Salat-i-Vusta (The Midmost Prayer)** {#sec-salat-i-vusta .unnumbered}

To be recited daily in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.

*And whoever wishes to pray for it should wash their hands, and while washing, they should say:*

1 My God, strengthen my hand to grasp Your book uprightly, not to be prevented by the forces of the world. Then preserve it from meddling in what is not within its domain. Indeed, You are the Capable, the All-Powerful.

*While washing the face, he says:*

2 My Lord, I have turned my face toward You. Illuminate it with the light of Your countenance, and then protect it from turning toward anyone else.

*And afterwards, let him stand facing the Qibla and say:*

3a God bears witness that there is no deity but Him; to Him belongs command and creation. He has made manifest the sunrise of appearance and the Speaker of the Mount, through whom the highest horizons have been illuminated, the Lote-Tree of the boundary has spoken, and the call has risen between earth and heaven. Sovereignty, dominion, might, and power belong to God, the Master of all worlds and the King of the Throne and the Earth.

*Then he bows down and says:*

4 Praise be to You, beyond my remembrance, the remembrance of those less than me, my description, and the description of those in the heavens and the earths.

*Then he stands for Qunoot and says:*

5 O my God, do not disappoint the one who clings to the fingers of hope in the tails of Your mercy and Your grace, O Most Merciful of the merciful.

*Then he sits and says:*

6a I bear witness to Your Oneness and Your Uniqueness, and that You are God, there is no god but You. You have made Your command manifest, fulfilled Your covenant, and opened the door of Your grace to those in the heavens and the earth. Blessings, peace, magnification, and glory be upon Your chosen ones, who are not hindered by worldly affairs from turning towards You, and who spend what they have in hopes of what is with You. Indeed, You are the Forgiving, the Generous.

### Shorter Alternate for Verses 3 & 6

*When the one praying wishes to recite:*

3b God bears witness that there is no deity but Him, the Overseer, the Self-Subsisting.

*Instead of the great verse, it suffices, and likewise it suffices in sitting to recite:*

6b I bear witness to Your oneness and Your Uniqueness, and that You are Allah, there is no god but You.
