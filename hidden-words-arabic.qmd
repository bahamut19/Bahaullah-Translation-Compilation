# **Kalimat-i-Maknunih (Hidden Words of Arabic)** {#sec-kalimat-i-maknunih-arabic .unnumbered}

**He is the Glorious, the Most Glorious**\
This is what has been revealed from the realm of might, through the tongue of power and strength, to the prophets of old. We have taken its essence and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a favor to the wise, that they may fulfill the covenant of God and discharge His trust within themselves, and that they may, with the essence of piety, be among those who attain in the realm of the spirit.

## Verses 1-9

**1 O Son of Spirit**\
Possess a pure, radiant, and illuminated heart at the outset, so that you may attain an everlasting, eternal, and ancient dominion.

**2 O Son of Spirit**\
The most beloved of all things in my sight is justice. Turn not away from it if you desire me, and neglect it not, that you may be faithful to me. By its aid, you will see with your own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and will know through your own knowledge and not through the knowledge of your neighbor. Ponder this in your heart: how it behooves you to be. Verily, this is my gift to you and my care for you. Keep it ever before your sight.

**3 O Son of Man**\
I was in my ancient essence and eternal being when I knew my love for you; therefore, I created you, cast my image upon you, and revealed my beauty to you.

**4 O Son of Man**\
I loved your creation; therefore, I created you. Wherefore, love me, that I may name you and establish you in the spirit of life.

**5 O Son of Being**\
Love me, that I may love you. If you love me not, my love can in no wise reach you. Know this, O servant.

**6 O Son of Being**\
Your paradise is my love; your heavenly home, reunion with me. Enter therein and tarry not. This is that which has been destined for you in our supreme kingdom and our exalted dominion.

**7 O Son of Man**\
If you love me, turn away from yourself; and if you seek my pleasure, regard not your own, that you may die in me and I may eternally live in you.

**8 O Son of Spirit**\
You shall find no rest save by renouncing yourself and turning unto me; for it behooves you to glory in my name, not in your own, to put your trust in my face, not in your own. For I desire to be loved above all that is.

**9 O Son of Being**\
My love is my stronghold; he that enters therein is safe and secure, and he that turns away shall surely stray and perish.

## Verses 10-18

**10 O Son of the Word**\
You are my stronghold; enter it, that you may be safe. My love is within you; recognize it in yourself, that you may find me near.

**11 O Son of Being**\
You are my lamp and my light is within you. Kindle it and seek not any other but me, for I created you rich and bestowed upon you my complete bounty.

**12 O Son of Being**\
I made you with the hands of power and created you with the fingers of might. I have placed within you the essence of my light; be content with it and seek nothing else. For my craftsmanship is perfect and my decree is binding. Do not doubt it, nor harbor suspicion concerning it.

**13 O Son of Spirit**\
I created you rich; why do you make yourself poor? I made you noble; why do you abase yourself? From the essence of knowledge, I manifested you; why do you seek learning from anyone but me? With the clay of love, I molded you; why do you busy yourself with another? Turn your sight inward, that you may find me standing within you, powerful, mighty, and self-subsisting.

**14 O Son of Man**\
You are my dominion, and my dominion never perishes; how can you fear your own perishing? You are my light, and my light shall never be extinguished; why do you dread extinction? You are my splendor, and my splendor shall never be obscured. You are my garment, and my garment shall never wear out. Rest in your love for me, that you may find me in the highest horizon.

**15 O Son of the Word**\
Turn your face toward mine and turn away from all else, for my sovereignty endures forever, and my dominion lasts eternally. Should you seek another, you will never find it, even if you search all of existence for eternity.

**16 O Son of Light**\
Forget all else and commune with my spirit. This is the essence of my command; turn towards it.

**17 O Son of Man**\
Rely on me alone and not on anyone else, for nothing else will ever suffice you.

**18 O Son of Spirit**\
Do not ask of me what we do not desire for yourself. Then be content with what we have ordained for your face, for this will benefit you if you are content with it.

## Verses 19-27

**19 O Son of the Supreme Vision**\
I have placed within you a spirit from myself so that you may be my beloved. Why have you abandoned me and sought another as your beloved?

**20 O Son of Spirit**\
My right over you is great and cannot be forgotten. My favor upon you is immense and cannot be obscured. My love for you exists and cannot be veiled. My light shines for you and cannot be hidden.

**21 O Son of Man**\
I have destined for you the purest fruits from the most exalted tree. How is it that you have turned away from it and been content with that which is lesser? Return to that which is better for you in the highest horizon.

**22 O Son of Spirit**\
I created you lofty, yet you have made yourself lowly. Ascend to what you were created for.

**23 O Son of the Cloud**\
I call you to eternal life, yet you seek annihilation. Why have you turned away from what I love and turned toward what you desire?

**24 O Son of Man**\
Do not overstep your bounds, nor claim that which does not befit you. Bow before the visage of your Lord, the Mighty and Powerful.

**25 O Son of Spirit**\
Do not pride yourself over the poor with the pride of your soul, for I walk before them and see you in your wretched state, and I curse you for eternity.

**26 O Son of Being**\
How have you forgotten your own faults and busied yourself with the faults of my servants? Whoever acts thus is cursed by me.

**27 O Son of Man**\
Do not breathe a word of another's faults while you remain faulty yourself. If you do otherwise, you are accursed, and I am witness to this.

## Verses 28-36

**28 O Son of Spirit**\
Know with certainty that whoever enjoins justice upon others yet indulges in depravity within himself is not of me, even if he bears my name.

**29 O Son of Being**\
Do not ascribe to others what you do not desire for yourself, and do not say what you do not practice. This is my command to youâ€”observe it.

**30 O Son of Man**\
Do not withhold your face from my servant if he asks you for something, for his face is my face. Be ashamed before me.

**31 O Son of Being**\
Bring yourself to account each day before you are summoned to account, for death will come suddenly, and you will stand in judgment over your own self.

**32 O Son of the Cloud**\
I made death a glad-tiding for you; why do you grieve over it? I made light a radiance for you; why do you veil yourself from it?

**33 O Son of Spirit**\
I bring you glad tidings of light; rejoice in it. I call you to the sanctuary of holiness; take refuge therein, that you may rest forevermore.

**34 O Son of Spirit**\
The Spirit of Holiness gives you glad tidings of intimacy; why do you grieve? The Spirit of Command strengthens you in the Cause; why do you veil yourself? The light of my countenance walks before you; why do you stray?

**35 O Son of Man**\
Grieve not save in your distance from us, and rejoice not save in your nearness to us and your return unto us.

**36 O Son of Man**\
Rejoice in the gladness of your heart, that you may be prepared to meet me and become a mirror for my beauty.

## Verses 37-45

**37 O Son of Man**\
Do not deprive yourself of the beautiful robe of my bounty, nor withhold your share from the wondrous fountains of my grace, lest you be overtaken by thirst in the eternity of my being.

**38 O Son of Being**\
Observe my laws out of love for me, and restrain yourself from your desires in pursuit of my good pleasure.

**39 O Son of Man**\
Do not abandon my commandments out of love for my beauty, and do not forget my counsels in your quest for my satisfaction.

**40 O Son of Man**\
Run across the plains of the unseen, then hasten into the fields of the heavens. You will find no rest except through submission to my command and humility before my face.

**41 O Son of Man**\
Magnify my command, that I may reveal to you the mysteries of greatness and radiate upon you the ancient lights.

**42 O Son of Man**\
Be humble before me, that I may be humble before you. Be a helper to my cause, that you may be victorious in my dominion.

**43 O Son of Being**\
Remember me on my earth, that I may remember you in my heaven, so that your eyes may be gladdened and mine likewise delighted.

**44 O Son of the Throne**\
Your hearing is my hearing; hear with it. Your sight is my sight; see with it. Thus, you will witness, in your innermost self, exalted sanctification for me, and I will bear witness to your lofty station within my essence.

**45 O Son of Being**\
Give your life in my path, pleased with me and grateful for my decree, that you may find rest with me in the canopies of grandeur behind the veils of might.

## Verses 46-54

**46 O Son of Man**\
Reflect on your condition and consider your deeds. Would you prefer to die upon your bed or be martyred in my path upon the dust, becoming the dawning-place of my Cause and the manifestation of my light in the highest paradise? Be just, O servant.

**47 O Son of Man**\
If my beauty were to be adorned by your blood-stained hair, it would be more precious to me than the creation of the two worlds and the radiance of both realms. Strive for this, O servant.

**48 O Son of Man**\
Everything has a sign; the sign of love is patience in my decree and endurance in my trials.

**49 O Son of Man**\
The true lover longs for tribulation as the sinner yearns for forgiveness and the guilty for mercy.

**50 O Son of Man**\
If no tribulation touches you in my path, how can you walk the ways of those content with my pleasure? If no hardship kindles your yearning for my meeting, how can you attain the light of love for my beauty?

**51 O Son of Man**\
My tribulation is my providence; outwardly it is fire and vengeance, yet inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten to it, that you may become an eternal light and an ancient spirit. This is my commandâ€”understand it.

**52 O Son of Man**\
If a blessing reaches you, do not rejoice in it, and if abasement touches you, do not grieve over it, for both shall pass away in due time and vanish in a moment.

**53 O Son of Being**\
If poverty befalls you, do not sorrow, for the sovereign wealth will descend upon you in the course of days. Fear not abasement, for honor shall come to you in the fullness of time.

**54 O Son of Being**\
If you desire this everlasting and eternal dominion, and this ancient and eternal life, forsake this fleeting and perishable sovereignty.

## Verses 55-63

**55 O Son of Being**\
Do not busy yourself with the world, for with fire we test gold, and with gold we test the servants.

**56 O Son of Man**\
You desire gold, and I desire your sanctification from it. You think wealth lies in possessing it, but I know true wealth lies in your detachment from it. By my life, this is my knowledge, and that is your assumptionâ€”how can my command align with yours?

**57 O Son of Man**\
Spend my wealth upon my poor, that you may spend in heaven from treasures of eternal glory and imperishable majesty. Yet, by my life, offering your soul is even more beautiful, if you could see through my eyes.

**58 O Son of Man**\
The temple of existence is my throne; cleanse it of all things, that I may be established therein and rest upon it.

**59 O Son of Being**\
Your heart is my home; sanctify it for my descent. Your spirit is my place of revelation; purify it for my manifestation.

**60 O Son of Man**\
Plunge your hand into my bosom, that I may lift my head radiant and resplendent from your bosom.

**61 O Son of Man**\
Ascend to my heaven, that you may behold my union and drink from the pure wine of an unmatched chalice and the cups of undying glory.

**62 O Son of Man**\
Days have passed over you, and you have occupied yourself with the whims of your soul, caught in fancies and illusions. How long will you slumber on your carpet? Lift your head from sleep, for the sun has risen to its zenith, that it may shine upon you with the lights of beauty.

**63 O Son of Man**\
I have shone my light upon you from the horizon of the Mount, and I have breathed the spirit of splendor into the Sinai of your heart. Empty yourself of veils and doubts, then enter upon the carpet, that you may be ready for eternity and worthy of meeting me, so that no death, fatigue, or weariness may seize you.

## Verses 64-71

**64 O Son of Man**\
My eternity of creation, I have created for youâ€”make it a garment for your being. My oneness of innovation, I have fashioned for youâ€”make it the robe of your soul, that you may shine with my self-subsistence forever.

**65 O Son of Man**\
My grandeur is my gift to you, and my majesty is my mercy upon you. What is befitting of my essence is beyond comprehension and cannot be encompassed by anyone. I have stored it in the treasures of my mystery and the vaults of my command, as a grace for my servants and a mercy for my creation.

**66 O Children of Essence in the Unseen**\
You shall be withheld from my love, and souls shall tremble at my mention, for minds cannot encompass me, nor can hearts contain me.

**67 O Son of Beauty**\
My spirit, my care, my mercy, and my beautyâ€”all that I have revealed to you through the tongue of power and inscribed with the Pen of mightâ€”I have sent down according to your capacity and understanding, not according to my station and melody.

**68 O Children of Man**\
Do you know why we created you all from one dust? That no one should exalt themselves over another. Reflect at all times on how you were created. Since we created you all from one substance, it is incumbent upon you to be as one soul, walking with the same feet, eating with the same mouth, and dwelling in the same land, so that from your inmost being, your deeds, and your actions, the signs of unity and the essence of detachment may be manifest. This is my counsel to you, O assembly of light. Take heed of it, that you may obtain the fruits of holiness from the tree of might and glory.

**69 O Children of Spirit**\
You are my treasures, for within you I have stored the pearls of my mysteries and the gems of my knowledge. Guard them, lest the unworthy among my servants and the wicked among my creation discover them.

**70 O Son of Him Who Stood in the Kingdom of His Self**\
Know that I have sent to you all the fragrances of sanctity, completed the word upon you, perfected the bounty with you, and accepted for you what I accepted for myself. Be content with me, then give thanks to me.

**71 O Son of Man**\
Write down all that we have revealed to you with the ink of light upon the tablet of the soul. And if you are unable to do so, let the ink be the essence of the heart. And if you still cannot, then write with the crimson ink that has been shed in my path, for it is sweeter to me than all else, that its light may endure forever.
