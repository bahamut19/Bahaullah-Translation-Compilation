## Verses 1-9

1 O Son of the Spirit,

At the beginning of speech, possess a pure, good, enlightened heart so that you may possess an eternal, lasting, timeless, ancient kingdom.

2 O Son of the Spirit,

The dearest thing to me is fairness. Do not turn away from it if you aspire to me and do not be negligent of it so that you may be trustworthy to me. By doing so, you are granted to witness things with your own eyes, not through the eyes of others, and to understand them with your own understanding, not anyone else's in the world. Reflect on this, how you should be. This is my gift to you and my favor upon you, so keep it in front of your eyes.

3 O Son of Man,

In the eternity of My essence and the ancientness of My being, I knew My love for you; thus, I created you, cast upon you My likeness, and revealed to you My beauty.

4 O Son of Man,

I loved your creation, so I created you; love Me so that I may remember you, and in the spirit of life, I will establish you.

5 O Son of Being,

Love Me so that I may love you. If you do not love Me, I will never love you. Know this, O servant.
