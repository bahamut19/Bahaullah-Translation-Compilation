## Verses 1-9

1 O Son of the Spirit,

At the beginning of speech, possess a pure, good, enlightened heart so that you may possess an eternal, lasting, timeless, ancient kingdom.

2 O Son of the Spirit,

The dearest thing to me is fairness. Do not turn away from it if you aspire to me and do not be negligent of it so that you may be trustworthy to me. By doing so, you are granted to witness things with your own eyes, not through the eyes of others, and to understand them with your own understanding, not anyone else's in the world. Reflect on this, how you should be. This is my gift to you and my favor upon you, so keep it in front of your eyes.

3 O Son of Man,

In the eternity of My essence and the ancientness of My being, I knew My love for you; thus, I created you, cast upon you My likeness, and revealed to you My beauty.

4 O Son of Man,

I loved your creation, so I created you; love Me so that I may remember you, and in the spirit of life, I will establish you.

5 O Son of Being,

Love Me so that I may love you. If you do not love Me, I will never love you. Know this, O servant.

6 O Son of Being,

Your contentment is My love, and your paradise is My presence. Enter it and do not be patient. This is what has been destined for you in Our highest kingdom and Our most exalted dominion.

7 O Son of Man,

If you love Myself, then turn away from yourself, and if you desire My pleasure, then disregard your own, so that you may perish in Me and I may eternally exist in you.

8 O Son of the Spirit,

Comfort is only ordained for you in your turning away from yourself and your turning towards Me, for your glory should be in My name, not in your own, and your reliance should be on My face, not on your own. For it is I alone who love to be loved above everything.

9 O Son of Being,

My love is my fortress; whoever enters it will be saved and secure, and whoever turns away will go astray and perish.

## Verses 10-18

10 O Son of Utterance,

You are my fortress; enter it to be safe. My love is in you; recognize it within yourself so that you may find Me near.

11 O Son of Being,

You are My niche and My lamp is within you; draw light from it and do not seek others, for I have created you rich and I have bestowed My bounty upon you in abundance.

12 O Son of Being,

I have made you with the hands of power and created you with the fingers of might, and I have placed within you the essence of My light. Be content with it and seek nothing else, for My work is perfect and My command is binding. Have no doubt in it, and do not be uncertain about it.

13 O Son of Spirit,

I created you rich, why do you bring yourself down to poverty? I made you noble, why do you demean yourself? From the essence of knowledge I made you manifest, why do you immerse yourself in ignorance? From the clay of love I molded you, why are you occupied with someone other than Me? Turn your sight onto your own self, so you may find Me standing within you, powerful, capable, and self-subsisting.

14 O Son of Man,

You are My kingdom and My kingdom shall never perish; how can you fear your own annihilation? You are My light and My light shall never be extinguished; how can you be disturbed by your own extinguishment? You are My glory and My glory shall never be veiled; and you are My robe and My robe shall never wear out. Rest in your love for Me, so that you may find Me in the highest horizons.

15 O Son of Utterance,

Turn your face towards Me and turn away from anything other than Me, for My sovereignty is eternal, never ceasing, and My kingdom is everlasting, never changing. If you seek anything other than Me, you will find nothing, no matter how you search in all of existence, eternally and timelessly.

16 O Son of Light,

Forget everything other than Me and find comfort in My spirit. This is from the essence of My command, so turn towards it.

17 O Son of Man,

Be content with Me and seek no one else besides Me, for nothing other than Me will ever satisfy you.

18 O Son of Spirit,

Do not ask of Me what you do not desire for yourself, then be satisfied with what We have ordained for you. What is beneficial for you is this, if you accept it with contentment.

## Verses 19-27

19 O Son of the Supreme Horizon,

I have breathed into you a spirit from Me so that you might be a beloved to Me; why have you abandoned Me and sought a beloved other than Me?

My right upon you is great and should not be forgotten, my favor to you is vast and cannot be overshadowed, my love in you is present and cannot be concealed, and my light for you is evident and cannot be hidden.

21 O Son of Man,

I have destined for you fruits from the most glorious tree, how could you turn away from it and be content with what is lesser? Return to what is better for you in the highest horizon.

22 O Son of Spirit,

I have created you lofty, but you have made yourself lowly; ascend to that for which you were created.

23 O Son of Darkness,

I call you to eternity, but you seek extinction. Why have you turned away from what We desire and inclined toward what you desire?

24 O Son of Man,

Do not exceed your limits nor claim what is not fitting for you. Prostrate before the dawning-place of your Lord, the Possessor of Power and Authority.

25 O Son of Spirit,

Do not take pride over the poor with self-glory, for I walk before him, and see you in your adverse condition, and I curse upon you forever.

26 O Son of Existence,

How have you forgotten your own flaws and preoccupied yourself with the flaws of My servants? Upon anyone who does this, My curse is upon them.

27 O Son of Man,

Do not breathe in the fault of anyone as long as you yourself are flawed. If you do otherwise, you are cursed, and I bear witness to that.

## Verses 28-36

28 O Son of Spirit,

Be certain that he who commands people to justice but commits indecency himself is not of me, even if he bears my name.

29 O Son of Being,

Do not attribute to another what you do not like for yourself, and do not say what you do not do. This is my command to you, so act upon it.

30 O Son of Man,

Do not deny the face of my servant when he asks you for something; for his face is my face, so be ashamed before me.

31 O Son of Being,

Account for yourself every day before you are held accountable, for death will come to you suddenly and you will stand to account for yourself.

32 O Son of Ignorance,

I have made death a glad tidings for you, how can you be saddened by it. And I have made light a radiance for you, how can you veil yourself from it.

33 O Son of the Spirit,

With the glad tidings of light I give you good news, so rejoice in it. And I call you to the abode of holiness, take refuge in it, that you may rest for eternity.

34 O Son of the Spirit,

The Holy Spirit gives you glad tidings of joy, how can you be sad? And the Spirit of Command strengthens you in your tasks, how can you hide? And the light of the countenance walks before you, how can you go astray?

35 O Son of Man,

Do not grieve except in your distance from Us, and do not rejoice except in your nearness to Us and your return to Us.

36 O Son of Man,

Rejoice in the joy of your heart, so that you may be prepared for My meeting and a mirror to My beauty.

Magnify My command that I may reveal unto you the secrets of greatness, and shine upon you with the lights of eternity.

42 O Son of Man,

Be submissive to Me so that I may be humble towards you, and support My command so that you may be supported in the Kingdom.

43 O Son of Being,

Remember Me in My earth so that I may remember you in My heaven; that your eye may be comforted thereby, and My eye may be comforted thereby as well.

44 O Son of the Throne,

Your hearing is My hearing, so listen with it; your sight is My sight, so see with it; that you may bear witness in your inner self to My supreme sanctification, so that I may bear witness for you in Myself to an exalted station.

45 O Son of Existence,

Strive in My path, content with Me and grateful for My decree, so that you may rest with Me in the domes of grandeur, behind the curtains of might.

## Verses 46-54

46 O Son of Man,

Contemplate your affairs and ponder upon your deeds. Do you prefer to die in bed, or to be martyred in My path on the soil, to be the rising sun of My cause and the manifestor of My light in the highest paradise? Be fair, O servant.

47 O Son of Man,

The beauty of My countenance is adorned by your hair dyed with your own blood. That is greater in My estimation than the creation of the two realms and the illumination of the two worlds. Therefore strive for this, O servant.

48 O Son of Man,

Everything has a sign; the sign of love is patience in My decree and endurance in My trials.

The sincere lover longs for trials as the sinner longs for forgiveness and the offender for mercy.

50 O Son of Man,

If you do not face tribulation in My path, how can you tread the paths of those who are contented in My satisfaction? And if hardship does not touch you, longing to meet Me, how can light reach you, loving My beauty?

51 O Son of Man,

My tribulation is My blessing; outwardly it is fire and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten unto it that you may become an everlasting light and an immortal spirit. This is My command - know it.

If a blessing befalls you, do not exult in it; if humiliation reaches you, do not grieve over it. For both will vanish in a moment and fade away in time.

53 O Child of Existence,

If poverty affects you, don't despair, because the source of wealth will bless you in due time. Don't fear humiliation, because one day you will surely be graced with honor.

54 O Child of Existence,

If you love this everlasting, eternal state and this primordial, timeless life, then forsake this transient, fleeting world.

## Verses 55-63

55 O Child of Existence,

Do not be preoccupied with this world; for as fire is used to test gold, gold is used to test the servants.

56 O son of man,

You desire gold while I aim to purify you from it. You recognize wealth in possessing it, whereas I see wealth in your renunciation of it. This is my knowledge and that is your assumption; how can my command coincide with your will?

57 O son of man,

Spend my wealth on my poor, so you may spend in the heavens from the treasures of an everlasting honor and the reserves of an unperishing glory; but by my command, the expenditure of the soul is more beautiful if you could see with my eyes.

58 O son of humanity,

62 O son of man,

Days have passed over you while you were occupied with what your self desires from illusions and delusions. How long will you remain sleeping on your bed? Lift your head from sleep; the sun has risen in the middle of the zenith, it may shine upon you with the lights of beauty.

63 O son of man,

I have shone the light upon you from the horizon of the mountain, and blew the spirit of majesty into the Sinai of your heart; so empty your self from veils and delusions, then enter upon the mat so that you become capable of lasting and suitable for meeting, so that death, struggle, and sunset do not take you.

## Verses 64-71

64 O son of man,

I have created my eternity for you, make it a garment for your temple. And my uniqueness that I invented for your sake, make it the shirt of your soul so you may radiate my self-sustaining existence forever.

65 O son of man,

My greatness is my gift to you, and my pride is my mercy upon you. What is fitting for my essence, no one can grasp and no soul can enumerate. I have stored it in the treasuries of my secret and the vaults of my command, out of kindness to my servants and compassion for my creation.

66 O children of the unseen essence,

You will be prevented from my love and souls will be disturbed from my remembrance; for minds cannot bear me, and hearts cannot contain me.

67 O son of beauty,

By my spirit, my care, then my mercy and my beauty, everything I've sent down to you from the tongue of power, and wrote it with the pen of strength, we have sent it down according to your capacity and tune, not according to my status and tune.

68 O children of man,

Did you realize why we created you from the same dust; so that no one would boast over another. Contemplate at all times about your own creation; thus, just as we created you from one substance, you should be like one soul, walking on a single leg, eating from a single mouth, dwelling on a single land; so that signs of unity and gems of abstraction would appear from your being, deeds, and actions. This is my advice to you, O assembly of lights, take counsel from it, so you may find the fruits of sanctity from a sturdy tree of dignity.

69 O children of the spirit,

You are my treasuries, for within you I have stored the pearls of my mysteries and the jewels of my knowledge. Preserve them, lest they fall into the sight of the envious amongst my servants and the wicked of my creation.

70 O son of him who stands in the kingdom of his own self,

Know that I have sent to you all the fragrances of holiness, and have completed my word upon you, and have perfected my favor unto you, and have been pleased for you what I have been pleased for myself. So, be content with me and then be grateful to me.

71 O son of man,

Write all that We have cast unto you of the ink of light on the tablet of the spirit. And if you are not capable of doing that, make the ink from the essence of the heart. And if you are not able to, then write with the red ink that was shed in My path; for it is sweeter to Me than everything, so that its light may remain forever.
