He is the Splendid, the Most Splendid.

This is what was revealed from the dominion of might, by the tongue of power and strength to the Prophets of old. We have taken its jewels and dressed it in the robe of brevity as a favor to the clergy, so they may fulfill the covenant of God and perform His trust within themselves, and to be among the successful with the essence of piety in the land of the soul.

## Verses 1-9

1 O Son of the Spirit,

At the beginning of speech, possess a pure, good, enlightened heart so that you may possess an eternal, lasting, timeless, ancient kingdom.

2 O Son of the Spirit,

The dearest thing to me is fairness. Do not turn away from it if you aspire to me and do not be negligent of it so that you may be trustworthy to me. By doing so, you are granted to witness things with your own eyes, not through the eyes of others, and to understand them with your own understanding, not anyone else's in the world. Reflect on this, how you should be. This is my gift to you and my favor upon you, so keep it in front of your eyes.

3 O Son of Man,

In the eternity of My essence and the ancientness of My being, I knew My love for you; thus, I created you, cast upon you My likeness, and revealed to you My beauty.

4 O Son of Man,

I loved your creation, so I created you; love Me so that I may remember you, and in the spirit of life, I will establish you.

5 O Son of Being,

Love Me so that I may love you. If you do not love Me, I will never love you. Know this, O servant.

6 O Son of Being,

Your contentment is My love, and your paradise is My presence. Enter it and do not be patient. This is what has been destined for you in Our highest kingdom and Our most exalted dominion.

7 O Son of Man,

If you love Myself, then turn away from yourself, and if you desire My pleasure, then disregard your own, so that you may perish in Me and I may eternally exist in you.

8 O Son of the Spirit,

Comfort is only ordained for you in your turning away from yourself and your turning towards Me, for your glory should be in My name, not in your own, and your reliance should be on My face, not on your own. For it is I alone who love to be loved above everything.

9 O Son of Being,

My love is my fortress; whoever enters it will be saved and secure, and whoever turns away will go astray and perish.

## Verses 10-18

10 O Son of Utterance,

You are my fortress; enter it to be safe. My love is in you; recognize it within yourself so that you may find Me near.

11 O Son of Being,

You are My niche and My lamp is within you; draw light from it and do not seek others, for I have created you rich and I have bestowed My bounty upon you in abundance.

12 O Son of Being,

I have made you with the hands of power and created you with the fingers of might, and I have placed within you the essence of My light. Be content with it and seek nothing else, for My work is perfect and My command is binding. Have no doubt in it, and do not be uncertain about it.

13 O Son of Spirit,

I created you rich, why do you bring yourself down to poverty? I made you noble, why do you demean yourself? From the essence of knowledge I made you manifest, why do you immerse yourself in ignorance? From the clay of love I molded you, why are you occupied with someone other than Me? Turn your sight onto your own self, so you may find Me standing within you, powerful, capable, and self-subsisting.

14 O Son of Man,

You are My kingdom and My kingdom shall never perish; how can you fear your own annihilation? You are My light and My light shall never be extinguished; how can you be disturbed by your own extinguishment? You are My glory and My glory shall never be veiled; and you are My robe and My robe shall never wear out. Rest in your love for Me, so that you may find Me in the highest horizons.

15 O Son of Utterance,

Turn your face towards Me and turn away from anything other than Me, for My sovereignty is eternal, never ceasing, and My kingdom is everlasting, never changing. If you seek anything other than Me, you will find nothing, no matter how you search in all of existence, eternally and timelessly.

16 O Son of Light,

Forget everything other than Me and find comfort in My spirit. This is from the essence of My command, so turn towards it.

17 O Son of Man,

Be content with Me and seek no one else besides Me, for nothing other than Me will ever satisfy you.

18 O Son of Spirit,

Do not ask of Me what you do not desire for yourself, then be satisfied with what We have ordained for you. What is beneficial for you is this, if you accept it with contentment.
