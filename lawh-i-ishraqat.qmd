# Lawh-i-Ishr치q치t (Tablet of Splendors) {#sec-lawh-i-ishr치q치t .unnumbered}

This is the Scroll of God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

He is God, exalted be His state, the Wisdom and the Explanation.

## Sermon One

1 Praise be to God, Who alone is vested with majesty, power, and beauty, and Who uniquely embodies glory, strength, and splendor. He is sanctified above being grasped by imagination or equated with any peer or likeness. He has elucidated His straight path with the most eloquent explanation and discourse. Indeed, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted.

2 When He willed to initiate the unique creation, He distinguished the visible, radiant point from the horizon of His will. This point revolved in every realm, in every form, until it reached the ultimate station by the command of God, the Lord of beings. It is the center of the circle of names and the seal of the manifestations of letters in the kingdom of creation. Through it, what signifies the most hidden secret and the intricately adorned symbol, representing the Greatest Name, became apparent in the luminous scroll and the sacred, blessed, white leaf.

3 As it connected with the second letter that emerged at the beginning of the second \[phase\], the orbits of explanation and meanings revolved, the eternal light of God shone forth, piercing the face of the sky of proof, and from it emerged fires. Blessed is the Merciful, Who cannot be indicated by signs, expressed in words, known through remembrances, or described by traces. Indeed, He is the commanding, the bestowing One at the beginning and the end, and He has appointed guardians and watchmen for them from the armies of power and might. Indeed, He is the Protector, the Mighty, the Chosen.

## Sermon Two

4 The sermon has been revealed twice, as the repeated \[verses\] were revealed twice. And praise be to God, who manifested the Point and detailed from it the knowledge of what was and what will be, and made it a herald of His name and a bearer of good tidings of His greatest revelation, before which the nations trembled and light shone from the horizon of the world.

5 Indeed, it is the Point which God made the sea of light for His sincere servants, and a sphere of fire for those among His creation who turn away and the atheists among His creatures who have exchanged God's bounty for ingratitude, and the heavenly table for hypocrisy, and led their followers to the worst abode. These are servants who have displayed hypocrisy in the horizons and broken the covenant on the day when the Ancient Temple rose upon the Greatest Throne, and the caller called from the right side of the sacred valley: "O concourse of the Bayan, fear the Merciful.

6 This is He whom Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and before Him the Spirit, and before Him the Speaker \[Moses\], have mentioned. And this Point of the Bayan calls out before the Throne and says: 'By God, you were created to remember this greatest news and this straightest path, which was concealed in the hearts of the prophets and stored in the breasts of the chosen ones, and written by the Supreme Pen in the tablets of your Lord, the Owner of Names.' Say: 'Die in your rage, O people of hypocrisy. He has appeared who does not miss anything from His knowledge, and has come who is the mouthpiece of recognition, and the kingdom of the Bayan has been adorned, and every one who turns to God, the Lord of religions, has come, and every one who sits has risen, and every one who crawls has hastened to the mount of certainty.

7 This is a day which God has made a blessing for the righteous and a curse for the wicked, a mercy for those who turn \[to Him\] and wrath for those who deny and turn away.' Indeed, He has appeared with authority from Himself and sent down what nothing in His earth and heaven can equal. Fear the Merciful, O concourse of the Bayan, and do not commit what the people of the Furqan, who claimed faith in the nights and days, have committed. When the King of beings came, they turned away and disbelieved, until they issued a wrongful decree, lamented by the Mother of the Book in the return.

8 Remember, then look at their deeds and sayings, their ranks and stations, and what appeared from them when the Speaker of the Mount spoke and the trumpet was blown, and everyone in the heavens and the earth was struck down, except a number of the letters of the face. O concourse of the Bayan, put away your illusions and suppositions, then look with the eye of fairness to the horizon of the manifestation and what appeared from Him and was sent down from His side and what was brought against Him by His enemies. He is the One who accepted all afflictions to manifest His cause and exalt His word. He was imprisoned once in the Ta', another time in the Mim, then in the Ta' another time for the command of God, the Creator of the heavens, and in them \[He was\] under chains and shackles, longing for the command of God, the Mighty, the Bounteous.

9 O concourse of the Bayan, have you forgotten my admonitions and what appeared from my pen and was spoken by my tongue? Have you replaced my certainty with your illusions and my path with your desires? Have you discarded the foundations of God, His remembrance, and abandoned the laws of God and His commands? Fear God, abandon assumptions to their appearances, illusions to their sights, and doubts to their origins, then turn with luminous faces and pure hearts towards the horizon from which the sun of certainty has risen, by a command from God, the Lord of all religions.

## The Greatest Infallibility

10 Praise be to God, who has made the greatest infallibility a shield for the temple of His cause in the kingdom of creation, and has not ordained for anyone a share of this exalted rank and supreme station. It is a tapestry woven by the fingers of power for Himself, exalted be He. It is not fitting for anyone except for him who sits upon the throne of "He does what He wills," who acknowledges and confesses what has been inscribed at this time by the Supreme Pen. Indeed, he is among the people of monotheism and the companions of abstraction in the Book of God, the Lord of the beginning and the end.

11 And when the discourse reached this station, the fragrance of recognition wafted and the light of monotheism shone from the horizon of the sky of the Bayan. Blessed is the one who was attracted by the call to the highest apex and the utmost goal, and who understood from the rustling of my Supreme Pen what the Lord of the Last and the First intended. Indeed, he who has not drunk from our sealed nectar, whose seal we have broken with our name, the Self-Subsisting, has not attained the lights of monotheism and has not understood the purpose of the Books of God, the Lord of the Earth and the Heavens, and the Master of the Last and the First. And he shall be counted among the polytheists in the Book of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.

12 O noble seeker, we testify that you have clung to beautiful patience in days when the pen was prevented from flowing and the tongue from explaining in remembrance of the greatest infallibility and the supreme sign that you asked about the Oppressed One, to reveal to you its veil and covering, and to mention its secret, its command, its station, its abode, its affair, its elevation, and its sublimity. By the life of God, if we were to unveil the pearls of proof hidden in the shells of the sea of knowledge and certainty, and to bring forth the burgeoning meanings concealed in the chambers of the Bayan in the garden of recognition, the clamor of the scholars would rise from all directions, and you would see the party of God amidst the fangs of the wolves who disbelieved in God in the beginning and the end. Therefore, we restrained the pen for a long while in wisdom from the Merciful and to protect my friends from those who exchanged God's bounty for ingratitude and led their people to the abode of ruin.

13 O noble questioner, discerning one, who has attracted the highest celestial assembly with his lofty words, indeed for the birds of the kingdoms of my sovereignty and the doves of the gardens of my wisdom, there are warblings and melodies known only to God, the Owner of dominion and might. If even less than a needle's eye of \[this knowledge\] were to appear, the unjust would say what the first ones did not say, and they would commit what none in the ages and centuries have committed. They have denied God's grace, His proof, His argument, and His signs. They are lost and mislead others, yet they are unaware. They worship illusions and do not recognize \[the truth\]. They have taken assumptions as their lords besides God and do not understand. They have rejected the greatest ocean, hastening to the mere pond, and do not know. They follow their desires, turning away from God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

14 Say: By God, the Merciful has come with power and authority, at which the religions tremble, and the nightingale of the Bayan sings on the highest branch of recognition. He who was hidden in knowledge and inscribed in the Book has appeared.

15 Say: This is the day in which the Speaker of the Mount has established Himself on the Throne of Manifestation, and people stand for God, the Lord of the Worlds. This is the day in which the earth relates its stories, reveals its treasures, the seas their pearls, the Lote-Tree its fruits, the sun its radiance, the moons their lights, the sky its stars, the Hour its signs, the Resurrection its authority, the pens their traces, and the spirits their secrets. Blessed is he who recognized Him and succeeded in \[reaching\] Him, and woe to him who denied Him and turned away from Him. So I ask God to support His servants in returning, for He is indeed the Repentant, the Forgiving, the Merciful.

### Infallibility Has Various Meanings and Stations

16 O you who turns towards the highest horizon and drinks from my sealed nectar, dispensed by the hands of generosity, know that infallibility has various meanings and stations. He whom God has protected from error bears this name in one station, and likewise, those whom God has protected from mistakes, disobedience, turning away, disbelief, polytheism, and the like, are each referred to by the name of infallibility. As for the greatest infallibility, it is for him whose station is sanctified from commands and prohibitions, and purified from error and forgetfulness. He is a light that no darkness follows, and accuracy that no error touches. Even if he decrees upon water the ruling of wine, upon the sky the ruling of earth, and upon light the ruling of fire, it is truth without doubt, and no one has the right to object or question why or how. Those who object are indeed among those who turn away in the Book of God, Lord of the Worlds. He is not questioned about what He does, but they are all questioned.

17 He has come from the heaven of the unseen, with the banner of "He does what He wills," and the armies of power and choice. It is incumbent upon those below him to adhere to the laws and commandments they have been given. If they deviate from them even by a hair's breadth, their deeds are nullified. Observe, then remember, when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came, he said, and his saying is the truth: "And \[due\] to God from the people is a pilgrimage to the House." Likewise are prayers, fasting, and the rulings that shone from the horizon of the Book of God, Lord of the World, and the Educator of Nations. Everyone must follow what God has decreed, and he who denies it disbelieves in God, His signs, His messengers, and His books. Even if he decrees correctness as error, and disbelief as faith, it is the truth from Him. This is a station where error and disobedience are not mentioned and do not occur. Look at the blessed, revealed verse that made pilgrimage to the House obligatory for everyone. Those who stood after Him in command are obliged to act according to what they were commanded in the Book. No one may transgress the limits of God and His traditions. He who transgresses is among the erring in the Book of God, Lord of the Great Throne.

18 O observer looking towards the horizon of the Command, know that the will of God is not limited by the confines of His servants. He does not walk upon their paths. Everyone should adhere to His straight path. Indeed, if He were to rule that the right is like the left, or the south like the north, it would be true without doubt. He is praiseworthy in His actions and obeyed in His command. He has no partner in His rule and no assistant in His sovereignty. He does what He wishes and rules as He desires. Then know that all others are created by His command, a word from Him. They have neither movement nor stillness except by His command and permission.

19 O bird soaring in the air of love and affection, and observer gazing upon the lights of the face of your Lord, the Creator of existence, give thanks to God for unveiling to you what was concealed and hidden in knowledge, so that everyone may know that He has taken no partner nor minister for Himself in the greatest infallibility. He is the Source of commands and decrees, the Origin of knowledge and recognition. All others are commanded and governed, while He is the Ruler, the Commander, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.

### A Prayer for the Most Great Infallibility

20 When the breezes of the verses of manifestation draw you, and the pure Kauthar from the hands of your Lord's generosity, the Master of the Day of Resurrection, embraces you, say:

21 "My God, my God, to You be the praise for guiding me towards You, leading me to Your horizon, clarifying Your path for me, revealing Your sign to me, making me turn to You when most of Your servants among the scholars and jurists turned away, followed by those who followed them without clear evidence from You or a proof from Your side. Yours is the grace, O God of Names, and Yours is the praise, O Creator of the heavens, for quenching my thirst with Your sealed nectar bearing Your name, the Self-Subsisting, for drawing me near to You, making me recognize the dawning place of Your revelation, the source of Your verses, Your commands, Your decrees, the fountain of Your wisdom, and Your subtleties. Blessed is the land that has been graced with Your arrival, upon which Your throne of greatness has been established, where the fragrance of Your shirt, Your might, Your sovereignty, Your power, and Your authority has been diffused. I do not desire sight except to behold Your beauty, nor do I wish to hear except to listen to Your call and Your verses.

22 My God, my God, do not deprive eyes of seeing what You created them for, nor faces from turning towards Your horizon, standing at Your threshold of greatness, being present before Your throne, and humbling themselves in the glow of the lights of Your sun of grace. O Lord, it is I whose heart, liver, limbs, and both my outer and inner tongue bear witness to Your Oneness and Singularity, that You are God, there is no deity but You. You created creation for the knowledge of You and the service of Your command, to elevate their ranks on Your earth and to elevate their souls with what You revealed in Your scriptures, books, and tablets.

23 When You revealed Yourself and sent down Your verses, they turned away from You, disbelieved in You and what You manifested with Your power and strength. They stood against causing You harm, extinguishing Your light, quenching the fire of Your Lote-Tree, reaching such a level of injustice that they sought to spill Your blood and violate Your sanctity. This is like those whom You nurtured with Your hands of care and protected from the harm of the tyrants of Your creation and the rebels among Your servants, who were to champion Your verses before Your throne.

24 Alas, alas, for what they committed in Your days, breaking Your covenant and pact, denying Your verses, persisting in turning away, and committing acts that caused the inhabitants of Your kingdom to lament. When they despaired and sensed the scent of loss, they cried out, confused even to those closest to You and the dwellers of the pavilions of Your glory. They saw me, O my God, like a bewildered fish on dry land, crying out for Your aid, then Your mercy, O the one sought for help, O the one in whose grasp is the control of all people, male and female.

25 Whenever I think of my great misdeeds and major sins, despair seizes me from all sides. Yet whenever I reflect on the ocean of Your bounty, the sky of Your generosity, and the sun of Your grace, I smell the scent of hope from the right and left, from the south and north, as if all things are heralding the rains of the clouds of the sky of Your mercy and Your might, O the support of the sincere and the aim of the near ones. Your gifts, Your kindnesses, Your manifestations of grace, and Your care have encouraged me, for what does the nonexistent have to mention the One who manifested existence with a word from Him, and what does the annihilated have to describe the One established by proof as indescribable and unremembered?

26 You have always been sanctified beyond the perception of Your creation and exalted beyond the knowledge of Your servants. O Lord, You see the dead before Your face; do not deprive them of the cup of life through Your generosity and kindness, and the sick in front of Your throne; do not prevent them from the sea of Your healing. I ask You to support me in all states in remembering You and praising You and serving Your command, after knowing that what appears from the servant is limited by his own limitations and is not fitting for Your presence, nor appropriate for the carpet of Your glory and greatness. If not for Your praise, my tongue would not benefit me, and if not for Your service, my existence would not benefit me.

27 I do not love sight except for seeing the lights of Your highest horizon, nor do I desire hearing except for listening to Your sweetest call. Alas, alas, I do not know, O my God, my support, and my hope, whether You have decreed for me what will please my eye, gladden my chest, and rejoice my heart, or if Your irrevocable decree has prevented me from being present before Your throne, O Owner of antiquity and the sovereignty of nations. Your glory, sovereignty, greatness, and authority have killed me with the darkness of distance. Where is the light of Your nearness, O the goal of the knowers? And the tyranny of separation has destroyed me. Where is the light of Your union, O the beloved of the sincere?

28 You see, O my God, what has befallen me in Your path from those who denied Your right, broke Your covenant, argued with Your signs, and disbelieved in Your grace after its manifestation and Your word after its revelation, and Your proof after its completion. O Lord, my tongue's tongue, my heart's heart, my soul's soul, my outward and inward all testify to Your Oneness and Uniqueness, to Your power, authority, greatness, sovereignty, glory, exaltation, choice, and that You are God, there is no deity but You. You have always been a hidden treasure from sight and perception, and will always remain as You were in the eternity of eternities. The strength of the world does not weaken You, nor does the power of nations frighten You.

29 You are the One who opened the door of knowledge to the face of Your servants for the recognition of the dawn of Your revelation and the source of Your verses, the sky of Your manifestation, and the sun of Your beauty. You promised those on earth in Your books, scriptures, and pages the manifestation of Your Self and the unveiling of the glories of majesty from Your face, as You informed Your beloved by whom the light of the command shone from the horizon of Hijaz, and the light of truth blazed among the servants with Your saying, "On the day when people stand before the Lord of the worlds." And before him, You promised the Speaker to "Bring your people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of God." You informed the Spirit, Your prophets, and Your messengers before and after.

30 If what is hidden in the treasures of Your Supreme Pen is revealed in the remembrance of this greatest remembrance and Your great news, the people of the cities of knowledge and recognition would be struck down, except those whom You saved with Your power and protected with Your bounty and grace. I testify that You have fulfilled Your covenant and manifested what Your prophets and chosen ones foretold, and He has come from the horizon of glory and authority with the banners of Your verses and the standards of Your clear signs. He stood before the faces with Your power and authority, calling everyone to the highest pinnacle and the highest horizon, where neither the injustice of the scholars nor the tyranny of the rulers prevented Him. He stood with the greatest steadfastness and spoke with the highest call. The Bestower has come riding on the clouds. Approach, O people of the earth, with white faces and luminous hearts. Blessed is he who succeeded in meeting You, drank the nectar of union from Your hands of bounty, found the scent of Your verses, spoke Your praises, flew in Your air, was attracted by the pull of Your revelation, and entered the highest paradise, the station of encounter and vision before Your throne of greatness.

31 O Lord, I ask You by the greatest infallibility which You made the horizon of Your manifestation, by Your highest word by which You created creation and manifested the command, and by this name with which the names wept and the understandings of the knowers trembled, to make me detached from all but You, so that I move only by Your will, speak only by Your wish, and hear only Your remembrance and praise. To You be the praise, O my God, and to You be the thanks, O my hope, for You have clarified Your straight path for me, revealed to me Your great news, and supported me in turning towards the dawn of Your revelation and the source of Your command, after the turning away of Your servants and creation. I ask You, O Owner of the kingdom of eternity, by the rustling of Your Supreme Pen, by the burning, speaking fire in the green tree, and by the ship which You made special for the people of Baha, to make me steadfast in Your love, content with what You have decreed for me in Your book, and standing in Your service and the service of Your friends. Then support Your servants, O my God, in what raises Your command and in acting upon what You have revealed in Your book. Indeed, You are the Almighty, the Sovereign over what You wish, and in Your grasp is the control of all things. There is no deity but You, the Almighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise."

### This Greatest Bounty

32 O venerable one, we have shown you the sea and its waves, the sun and its radiance, the sky and its stars, the shells and their pearls. Give thanks to God for this greatest bounty and generosity that has encompassed the world. O you who turn towards the lights of the face, know that illusions have enveloped the inhabitants of the earth, preventing them from turning towards the horizon of certainty, its radiance, manifestations, and lights. Because of their doubts, they are barred from the Everlasting. They speak from their desires, unaware.

33 Among them are those who question whether the verses have been revealed. Say: "Indeed, by the Lord of the heavens! Has the Hour come? Indeed, it has passed, and the manifestation of the clear proofs has arrived. The ultimate truth has come with argument and proof. The awakening has appeared, and creation is in awe and turmoil. The earthquakes have come, and the tribes lament in fear of God, the Almighty, the Compeller. Say: 'The Resounding Blast has sounded, and this day belongs to God, the One, the Chosen.' And they ask if the calamity has been fulfilled. Say: 'Indeed, by the Lord of the Lords! Has the Resurrection arisen? Indeed, the Self-Subsisting has come with the kingdom of signs. Do you see people struck down? Indeed, by my Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious! Have the barren lands sunk? Indeed, the mountains have been scattered, and the Owner of attributes has spoken. Where are Paradise and Hell? Say: 'The former is for meeting Me, and the latter is your own self, O doubting polytheist.'

34 They claim not to see the balance. Say: 'Indeed, by my Merciful Lord! It is only seen by those with insight.' Have the stars fallen? Say: 'Indeed, when the Self-Subsisting was in the land of mystery.' Reflect, O people of insight! All the signs have appeared as We have extended the hand of power from the pocket of greatness and authority. The caller has called, the time has come, and the mountain dwellers are in the wilderness of standing, overwhelmed by the power of your Lord, the Creator of existence. The trumpeter asks if the trumpet has been blown. Say: 'Indeed, by the Sultan of manifestations! As He settled upon the throne of His name, the Merciful, the darkness was illuminated by the dawn of the mercy of your Lord, the source of lights. The breath of the Merciful has passed, and souls have trembled in the graves of bodies. Thus has the matter been decreed by God, the Mighty, the Bestower.

35 The disbelievers ask when the sky will split. Say: 'When you were in the graves of heedlessness and error among the polytheists.' Who will wipe their eyes and look right and left? Say: 'You are blinded today; there is no refuge for you.' They ask if the souls have been gathered. Say: 'Indeed, by my Lord! When you were in the cradle of illusions.' Do you see the Book revealed naturally? Say: 'It is in confusion. Fear, O people of understanding!' And some ask if they will be resurrected blind. Say: 'Indeed, by the Rider of the clouds! Paradise has been adorned with the meanings of supplication, and Hell has been ignited with the fire of the wicked. Say: 'The light has shone from the horizon of manifestation, and the horizons have been illuminated as the Owner of the Day of the Covenant has come. The doubters have lost, and those who turned with the light of certainty to the dawn of assurance have won. Blessed are you, O observer, for this Tablet has been revealed to you, from which souls soar. Preserve it, then recite it. By my life! It is the door of your Lord's mercy. Blessed is he who reads it in the evening and at dawn. We have heard your mention in this matter, from which the mountain of knowledge has crumbled, and the steps of glory have slipped. The splendor is upon the people of splendor who turned to the Almighty, the Bestower. The Tablet has ended, but the declaration has not. Be patient, for your Lord is the Most Patient. These are verses We revealed previously, at the beginning of our arrival in the Greatest Prison, and We sent them to you to recognize what the lying tongues uttered when God came with power and authority. The foundation of assumptions has been shaken, and the sky of illusions has split, while the people are in doubt and discord. They have denied God's argument and proof after it came from the horizon of power with the kingdom of signs. They abandoned what they were commanded and committed what they were forbidden in the Book. They made their desires their gods. Indeed, they are in heedlessness and error.

36 They read the verses and deny them, see the clear proofs and turn away from them. Indeed, they are in astonishing doubt. We have commanded our friends to fear God, the source of deeds and morals. He is the leader of the armies of justice in the city of splendor. Blessed is he who enters the shade of His luminous banner and clings to it. He is among the companions of the red ship mentioned in the Qayyum al-Asma. Say, O party of God, adorn your temples with the embroidery of trustworthiness and piety, then support your Lord with the armies of deeds and morals. We have forbidden you from corruption and argument in My books, scriptures, Psalms, and Tablets. We only intended your elevation and exaltation. The sky and its stars, the sun and its radiance, the trees and their leaves, the seas and their waves, and the earth and its treasures bear witness to this. We ask God to extend His friends and support them in what befits them in this blessed, mighty, and unique station. We ask Him to enable those around me to act according to what they were commanded by my Supreme Pen.

### Commanded the Servants Towards Righteousness

37 O Noble One, upon you be my glory and my care. Indeed, we have commanded the servants towards righteousness, yet they have acted in ways that grieve my heart and my pen. Listen to what has been revealed from the heaven of My will and the kingdom of My intention. My sorrow is not due to my imprisonment or what my enemies have inflicted upon me, but rather from those who attribute themselves to Me and commit acts that cause My sighs to rise and tears to fall.

38 We have advised them with various admonitions in different tablets. We ask God to grant them success, draw them near, and support them in what will bring tranquility to hearts and relief to souls, and to prevent them from what is not befitting for these days. Say, O My friends in My lands, listen to the counsel of one who advises you for the sake of God. Indeed, He created you, revealed to you what elevates and benefits you, taught you His straight path, and His great news.

### Entrust the Servants with the Fear of God

39 O Magnificent One, entrust the servants with the fear of God. By God, He is the foremost leader in the armies of Your Lord, and His soldiers are pleasing morals and good deeds. With these, throughout the ages and generations, the cities of hearts and minds have been opened, and the banners of victory and triumph have been raised on the highest standards. We remind you of trustworthiness and its station before God, your Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. One day, we intended to visit our green island, and upon our arrival, we saw its flowing rivers and entwined trees, with the sun playing through the leaves.

40 We turned to the right and saw what the pen cannot move to describe, and what the eye of the Master of the worlds witnessed in that most gentle, noble, blessed, and highest place. Then we turned to the left and saw a vision from the highest paradises, standing on a pillar of light, calling out with the highest call, "O assembly of the earth and the heavens, look at my beauty, my light, my emergence, and my radiance. By the truth of God, indeed, we are the trust, its manifestation, beauty, and reward for those who cling to it, recognize its status and station, and hold onto its hem. I am the greatest adornment for the people of splendor, the embroidery of glory for those in the kingdom of creation, and the greatest cause of the world's prosperity and the horizon of tranquility for the people of possibility. Thus, We have revealed to you what brings the servants closer to the Creator of existence."

41 The Supreme Pen has turned towards the luminous language to make the Magnificent One recognize the beautiful care of His Lord and be among the grateful.

### The Call is Loud But the Hearing Power is Scarce

42 O discerning one, who looks toward the highest horizon, the call is loud but the hearing power is scarce, or rather, absent. This wronged one remembers the divine allies in the mouth of the serpent. These days have come, causing dismay and alarm among the celestial assembly. The injustice of the world and the harm of nations have not prevented the Master of Eternity from remembering me or restrained His will. Souls that have been hidden behind the veil for years, upon seeing the luminous horizon of the command and the efficacious Word of God, have rushed out with swords of hatred and committed acts that the pen cannot describe and the tongue cannot express. The just are witnesses and attest to this: from the beginning, this wronged one has stood before the faces of kings and subjects, scholars and rulers, without veil or concealment, and with the highest call invited all to the straight path. No supporter but His pen, no helper but Himself. Those souls, unaware of the essence of the matter and heedless, have risen in opposition; they are the naysayers whom God mentioned in the Psalms and Tablets, informing His servants of their spread, noise, and misguidance. Blessed are the souls who see the mention of the Master of Eternity as absent and lost in the world and cling to the firm rope of God---a cling that doubts, insinuations, swords, and shields cannot prevent or deprive. Blessed are the steadfast and the firm.

43 The Supreme Pen, upon the request of that noble one, has mentioned the ranks and stations of the greatest infallibility. The purpose is that everyone with clear certainty knows that the Seal of the Prophets, may my soul be a sacrifice for him, had no doubt, likeness, or partner in his station. The saints, peace be upon them, were created by his word; they were the most knowledgeable and virtuous of servants and stood at the ultimate level of servitude, sanctifying the Divine Essence from doubt and likeness and purifying His being from partner and equal. This is the station of true monotheism and spiritual individuation. Those who were before this station were deprived and barred as is their right. The Point, may my soul be a sacrifice for him, says that if the Seal of the Prophets had not uttered the word of guardianship, guardianship would not have been created. Those before were polytheists, deeming themselves monotheists; they were the most ignorant of servants, considering themselves the most superior. The judgments, ranks, and stations of those heedless souls will be clear and known to every seer and knower on the Day of Judgment.

44 Seek the truth, O servants, and protect this manifestation from the suspicions and illusions of those before, and do not deprive yourselves of the radiance of the sun of true monotheism. O Magnificent, the wronged one of the world says: The radiant justice is hidden, the sun of fairness behind the clouds, the station of the guardian and protector, the thief stands, the place of the trustworthy is occupied by the traitor, sitting in the seat of governance in this city. Every moment, harm is inflicted from them. By the life of God, they have done what caused the greatest terror. Yet, the Supreme Pen is not and will not be prevented by the injustice of the world, purely out of grace and mercy, especially for the governors and ministers of the earth. We have recorded what causes preservation, protection, safety, and security, so perhaps the servants will be protected from the harm of the oppressors. Indeed, He is the Preserver, the Helper, the Supporter. The men of the Divine House of Justice must, in nights and days, pay attention to what has shone from the horizon of the Supreme Pen's heaven in educating servants, building lands, preserving souls, and protecting honor.

## The Illuminations (Splendors)

### First Illumination

45 When the sun of wisdom rose from the horizon of the heavens of governance, it spoke with this sublime word: The people of wealth, and the possessors of honor and power, should regard the sanctity of religion with the best creativity possible. Religion is a clear light and a strong fortress for the protection and comfort of the people of the world. It commands righteousness through the fear of God and forbids wrongdoing. If the lamp of religion remains hidden, chaos and disorder will find their way, and the lights of justice and fairness, and the sun of security and tranquility, will be obscured from their radiance. Every informed person bears witness and continues to bear witness to what has been mentioned.

### Second Illumination

46 We have commanded all to adhere to the Greatest Peace, which is the supreme cause for the preservation of humanity. The sovereigns of the world must, in agreement, cling to this matter, which is a great cause for the comfort and preservation of the world. They are the dawns of power and the rising places of divine authority. We beseech the truth to support them in whatever causes the comfort of His servants. A detailed explanation on this matter has previously been issued from the Supreme Pen. Blessed are those who act accordingly.

### Third Illumination

47 The implementation of laws is essential as it is the primary cause for the life of the world. The sky of divine wisdom is illuminated by two bright and radiant lights: consultation and compassion. The tent of world order is upheld and sustained by two pillars: punishment and recompense.

### Fourth Illumination

48 In this manifestation, the victorious troops are commendable deeds and virtues, and the leader and commander of these troops is the fear of God. He possesses all and reigns over all.

### Fifth Illumination

49 It is necessary and obligatory for every leader and sovereign to be aware of the conditions of their appointees and to assign positions proportionately to their capabilities. This ensures that the treacherous do not usurp the place of the trustworthy, and the plunderer does not take over the guard's quarters in the greatest prison. Some of the appointees, thankfully, are adorned with the embroidery of justice, while others, we seek refuge with God, are not. We implore God to guide all, so they may not be deprived of the fruits of the tree of trustworthiness and piety, nor be barred from the lights of the sun of justice and fairness.

50 The unity and agreement of the servants perpetually illuminate the world with the light of My command. The greatest cause of this unity is understanding each other's language and speech. Previously, in the Tablets of the Cause, we instructed the trustees of the House of Justice to adopt one language from the existing tongues or create a new one, and to choose one script from the chosen scripts. They should teach this to children in schools around the world so that the world may appear as one homeland, one piece. The most glorious fruit of the tree of knowledge is this sublime word: Carry the same load and leaf of the same branch. "The pride is not in loving one's homeland, but in loving the world." Previously, in this station, what causes the world's flourishing and the unity of nations was revealed. Blessed are the successful and the workers.

### Sixth Illumination

51 The unity and agreement of the servants are essential for perpetually illuminating the world with the light of My command. The greatest reason for this unity is the understanding of each other's language and speech. We have previously commanded in the Tablets that the trustees of the House of Justice should adopt one language from the existing languages or create a new one, and choose one script from the available scripts. They should teach this to children in schools across the world so that the world may appear as one homeland, one piece. The most glorious fruit of the tree of knowledge is this sublime word: Carry the same load and leaf of the same branch. "True pride is not in loving one's homeland, but in loving the world." Previously in this station, what causes the world's flourishing and the unity of nations was revealed. Blessed are the successful and the workers.

### Seventh Illumination

52 The Supreme Pen enjoins everyone to educate and nurture children. These verses, in this regard, were revealed from the heavens of Divine Will in the Most Holy Book during the first imprisonment: "It is incumbent upon every father to educate his son and daughter in learning and writing, and what has been specified in the Tablet. Those who neglect what they are commanded, the trustees have the right to take from them what is necessary for their education, if he is wealthy. If not, they should turn to the House of Justice, for we have made it a refuge for the poor and the needy. Indeed, whoever raises a son, or one of the sons, it is as if he has raised one of My own sons, upon him be My glory, care, and mercy that precedes all worlds."

### Eighth Illumination

53 This passage, penned by the Supreme Pen at this time and included in the Most Holy Book, declares that the affairs of the community depend on the men of the House of Justice of God. They are the trustees of God among His servants and the dawn places of His command in His lands.

54 O Party of God, the educator of the world is justice, featuring two main pillars: punishment and reward. These two pillars are like two springs, vital for the life of the world's people. As every day brings a new requirement and every moment a unique wisdom, issues should be referred to the House of Justice. They will implement what is deemed most appropriate for the times.

55 Those who stand in service of the Cause for the love of God receive divine inspirations. Obedience to all is essential. Political matters should be referred to the House of Justice, and religious practices should follow what God has revealed in the Book.

56 O people of Baha, you represent the dawns of love and the day-springs of divine care. Keep your tongues from cursing or slandering anyone. Safeguard your eyes from beholding anything indecent. Develop what you have; if it is accepted, the goal is achieved, and if not, abandon it, turning towards God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Do not grieve over the outcome, and avoid descending into corruption and strife.

57 It is hoped that under the shadow of the divine Lote-Tree of Bounty, you will be nurtured and act according to what God wills. Remember, all leaves are from one tree, and all drops from one ocean.

### Ninth Illumination

58 The religion and doctrine of God are purely about unity and concord among the people of the world. Revealed from the heaven of the will of the Sovereign of Eternity and made manifest, it should not be a cause for disagreement and discord. The supreme cause and the greatest reason for the manifestation and radiance of the light of unity is the divine religion and the heavenly law. It fosters the growth of the world, the education of nations, the tranquility of people, and the comfort of all within the lands, through divine principles and ordinances.

59 This grand gift bestows the cup of life, grants eternal existence, and offers everlasting bounty. The leaders of the earth, especially the trustees of the House of Justice of God, must exert utmost effort in protecting and elevating this station. They must also seek information about their subjects and be aware of the actions and affairs of each group from the manifestations of God's power, namely kings and leaders.

60 I implore them to strive, so that discord may vanish, and the horizons may be illumined with the light of concord. Everyone must adhere to and act upon what has flowed from the Supreme Pen. The truth and the atoms of the universe bear witness that what elevates, refines, nurtures, and disciplines the people of the earth has been mentioned and revealed by the Supreme Pen in scriptures and tablets.

61 I beseech God to support His servants in doing so. What this wronged one seeks from everyone is justice and fairness. Let them not be content with what has been revealed about this wronged one, but rather ponder upon it. By the Sun of Revelation, shining from the horizon of the Kingdom of the Merciful, had a clear sign been observed, or a vocal advocate been heard, we would not have exposed ourselves to the mockery, contempt, and fabrications of the people.

62 When entering Iraq, the command of God was dormant, and the breezes of Revelation were cut off. Many were withered, or rather, dead. Therefore, in the latter instance, the trumpet was blown again, and this blessed word flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur: "We blew into the trumpet another time," reviving the horizons with the breezes of Revelation and divine inspiration.

63 Now, from behind every veil, souls have rushed out towards the wronged one, denying and rejecting this greatest bounty. O people of fairness, if this Cause is denied, what Cause on earth can be affirmed or acknowledged? Those turning away have set about gathering the verses of this Revelation, taking them from whoever they find, showing affection, and counting themselves among each group of their respective religions.

64 Say, "Die in your rage. Indeed, it has come with a command that no one with vision, hearing, knowledge, justice, or fairness can deny." The Pen of Antiquity bears witness to this in this manifest moment.

## True Believers Act According to the Command

65 O Jalil, upon you be My glory. We direct the true believers to act according to the command, hoping they will be successful and implement what has descended from the heaven of the command. The benefit of the Merciful's explanation is related to the acting souls. We beseech God to support them in what He loves and is pleased with, to enable them to act with justice and fairness in this conclusive matter, to acquaint them with His signs, and to guide them to His straight path.

66 The Blessed Herald, may My soul be a sacrifice for Him, has revealed laws, but the world of command was contingent upon acceptance. Thus, this wronged one implemented some and revealed others in the Most Holy Book with different expressions, while pausing on some. The matter is in His hand; He does what He wills and decrees as He pleases, for He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Some laws have also been revealed through supplication. Blessed are the successful ones and blessed are those who act. The people of God must exert great effort so that the fire of malice and hatred, hidden in the hearts of factions, may be quelled by the elixir of exposition and the counsels of the world's sages, and the trees of existence may be adorned with fresh and invincible fruits. Indeed, He is the Compassionate Advisor, the Affectionate, the Generous. The glory of God, shining from the horizon of the heaven of generosity, is upon you, O people of Baha, and upon every steadfast, upright, firmly grounded, and knowledgeable one.

## Benefits and Profits of Gold & Silver (Usury)

67 As for the question about the benefits and profits of gold and silver, several years ago, specifically for the Name of God, Zayn al-Muqarrabin -- upon him be the Glory of God the Most Glorious -- this statement was revealed from the Kingdom of the Merciful. It is observed that most people are in need of this matter, for if there is no profit involved, affairs would remain stagnant and delayed. It is rare for a person to accommodate their peer, fellow citizen, or brother by giving or considering a benevolent loan. Therefore, as a grace upon the servants, We have ordained usury like other transactions that are common among people. That is, from the time this clear command descended from the heaven of will, profit from money is lawful, pure, and clean, so that the people of the earth may be joyfully engaged in the remembrance of the Beloved of the worlds, with utmost spirit and delight. Indeed, He decrees as He wishes and has made usury lawful just as He had prohibited it before. In His grasp is the dominion of the command; He acts and orders, and He is the All-Knowing Commander.

68 O Zayn al-Muqarrabin, be thankful to your Lord for this evident grace. The scholars of Iran, most of them, with a hundred thousand tricks and deceptions, were engaged in usury. However, they outwardly adorned it, in their opinion, with the garb of lawfulness, playing with the commands of God and His decrees, unaware. But this matter must be approached with moderation and fairness. The Supreme Pen has refrained from defining it precisely, as a wisdom from Him and a provision for His servants. We advise the friends of God to adhere to justice and fairness, and to what manifests the mercy and compassion of His beloved ones among them. Indeed, He is the Adviser, the Compassionate, the Noble. God willing, everyone will be strengthened in what has flowed from the Tongue of Truth. And if they act according to what has been mentioned, surely the Almighty, the Most Glorious, will bestow manifold blessings from the heaven of His bounty. Indeed, He is the All-Bountiful, the Forgiving, the Merciful. All praise be to God, the Exalted, the Supreme.

69 The implementation of these matters has been entrusted to the people of the House of Justice, so they may act according to the requirements of the time and wisdom. We once again advise everyone to adhere to justice, fairness, love, and satisfaction. Indeed, they are the people of Bah치 and the companions of the Crimson Ark, upon them be the peace of God, the Lord of Names, and the Creator of the Heavens.
