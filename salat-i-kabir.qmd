# **Salat-i-Kabir (The Great Prayer)** {#sec-salat-i-kabir .unnumbered}

*Conducted once in every twenty-four hours*

*The worshipper should stand facing God, and when he stands firm in his place, he looks to the right and left as one awaiting the mercy of his compassionate and merciful Lord, then says:*

1 O God of Names and Creator of the heavens, I ask You by the highest, most glorious lights of Your unseen to make my prayer a fire that burns away the veils that have prevented me from beholding Your beauty, and a light that guides me to the ocean of Your presence.

*Then he raises his hands in supplication to God, the Exalted, and says:*

2 O Desire of the world and Beloved of the nations, You see me turned towards You, detached from all else, holding fast to Your cord by whose movement all created things have been moved. O Lord, I am Your servant and the son of Your servant, present and standing before the power of Your will and purpose. I seek nothing but Your pleasure. I ask You by the ocean of Your mercy and the sun of Your bounty to deal with Your servant as You wish and as You please, and by Your sanctified glory beyond all mention and praise, whatever appears from You is the aim of my heart and the beloved of my soul. My God, my God, do not look upon my hopes and deeds, but to Your will which encompasses the heavens and the earth and Your greatest name, O Lord of the nations. I have desired nothing but what You have desired, and I love nothing but what You love.

*Then he prostrates and says:*

3 Glory be to You beyond being described by any description other than Yours or known by any knowledge other than Yours.

*Then he stands and says:*

4 O Lord, make my prayer a living water that sustains my being by the continuity of Your sovereignty, and that remembers You in every world of Your worlds.

*Then he raises his hands in supplication again and says:*

5 O You whose separation melts hearts and livers, and whose love ignites the flames of the people in the lands, I ask You by Your name which has subdued the horizons not to prevent me from what is with You, O Lord of all. O Lord, You see the stranger hasten to his highest homeland, the shade of the canopy of Your greatness, and the neighbor of Your mercy, and the sinner aiming for the ocean of Your forgiveness, and the lowly at the expanse of Your glory, and the poor at the horizon of Your wealth. The command is Yours in all that You desire. I bear witness that You are the praised in Your actions, the obeyed in Your decree, the chosen in Your command.

*Then he raises his hands and glorifies God three times* (God is the Most Glorious or God is the Greatest) *then bows in reverence to God, the Exalted, and says:*

6 O my God, You see my spirit trembling within my limbs and organs in yearning for Your worship and fervor for Your remembrance and praise, and it testifies to what Your tongue of command has testified in the kingdom of Your declaration and the dominion of Your knowledge. O Lord, I love to ask You in this station for all that is with You to prove my poverty and to elevate Your gifts and wealth, to manifest my incapacity and highlight Your power and might.

*Then he stands and raises his hands in supplication once again and says:*

7 There is no god but You, the Almighty, the Bestower. There is no god but You, the Judge in the beginning and the return. My God, my God, Your pardon has encouraged me, and Your mercy has strengthened me, and Your call has awakened me, and Your grace has raised me and guided me to You. Otherwise, I would have nothing to do with standing at the door of Your closeness or turning towards the lights shining from the horizon of Your will. O Lord, You see the needy knocking at the door of Your grace, and the perishing seeking the living water from the hands of Your generosity. The command is Yours in all states, O Lord of names, and to You belongs submission and contentment, O Creator of the heavens.

*Then he raises his hands three times and says:*

8 God is greater than every great.

*Then he prostrates and says:*

9 Glory be to You that the praises of the near ones ascend to the heaven of Your closeness, or that the birds of the hearts of the sincere ones reach the courtyard of Your gate. I bear witness that You are sanctified from all attributes and transcendent beyond all names. There is no god but You, the most exalted, the most glorious.

*Then he sits and says:*

10 I bear witness to what things and the supreme concourse and the highest paradise, and beyond it the tongue of greatness from the most glorious horizon, have borne witness, that You are God, there is no god but You, and the one who has appeared is indeed the concealed mystery and the treasured symbol by which the letter Kāf has been joined with its sustaining letter Nūn. I bear witness that he is the one inscribed by the Supreme Pen and mentioned in the books of God, the Lord of the Throne and the dust.

*Then he stands upright and says:*

11 O God of existence and Lord of the unseen and the seen, You see my tears and sighs, You hear my cries and laments, and the yearning of my heart. By Your glory, my wrongdoings have kept me from drawing near to You, and my sins have prevented me from entering the sanctuary of Your holiness. O Lord, Your love has exhausted me, Your separation has destroyed me, and Your distance has burned me. I ask You by the place of Your footsteps in this wilderness and the calls of Your chosen ones in this expanse and the breaths of Your revelation and the breezes of the dawn of Your appearance to ordain for me the visit to Your beauty and the practice of what is in Your Book.

*Then he glorifies God three times, bows and says:*

12 Praise be to You, O my God, for empowering me to remember and praise You, for making known to me the rising place of Your signs, for making me submissive to Your lordship, humble before Your divinity, and acknowledging what the tongue of Your greatness has spoken.

*Then he stands and says:*

13 My God, my God, my disobedience has broken my back, and my heedlessness has destroyed me. Whenever I reflect on my evil deeds and Your good deeds, my liver melts and my blood boils in my veins. O Beloved of the world, Your beauty makes the face ashamed to turn towards You, and the hands of hope are embarrassed to rise to the sky of Your generosity. You see, O my God, my tears preventing me from remembrance and praise, O Lord of the throne and the dust. I ask You by the signs of Your dominion and the secrets of Your might to deal with Your friends as befits Your bounty, O Lord of existence, and is worthy of Your grace, O sovereign of the unseen and the seen.

*Then he glorifies God three times and prostrates and says:*

14 Praise be to You, O our God, for sending down to us what brings us closer to You and provides us with every good You have revealed in Your books and scriptures. O Lord, we ask You to protect us from the armies of doubts and delusions. You are indeed the Mighty, the All-Knowing.

*Then he raises his head, sits and says:*

15 I bear witness, O my God, to what Your chosen ones have borne witness, and I acknowledge what the people of the highest paradise and the supreme garden, and those who have circled around Your great throne have acknowledged. The kingdom and dominion belong to You, O God of the worlds.
