## Questions Posed to Baha'u'llah

1 The letter from that esteemed individual is present before the Throne, and it rests upon the acknowledgment that none knows what is beyond Him, and everything within that context is under the divine scrutiny. The question posed was about how the letter 'Aleein transforms into 'Sajeen,' or how affirmation turns into negation, or how the fruitful tree becomes devoid of its delicacy, or how the mirror remains devoid of the illuminations of the sun of meanings. Truly, what an excellent question you have posed, and you are among the questioners. Your question is very well-received. Today, it is essential for anyone who finds themselves incapable of understanding the divine dilemmas to inquire from the divine law and the river of unifying wisdom, with hopes that perhaps they will taste a droplet of that drink and find rest on the carpet of tranquility.

2 And may your certainty be at ease, and we ask God to elevate you to the station where you witness the beauty of the Eternal with your sight, where the sight of all worlds is severed. And you hear its melodies with your hearing, and all hearts in the heavens and the earth are severed from it. And may He purify you from the filth of this world and what is in it, so that as you pass by anything, you would hear it declaring that there is no god but He. And the highest eminence is due to His glory in the highest assembly, and His light is between the earth and the heavens, and His grandeur is for those in the dominion of command and creation. Likewise, everything speaks if you are among those who listen.

## Transformation of Aleein Into Sajeen

3 For today, it is incumbent upon every soul, in the sight of God, to observe with their eyes, ears, and hearts His cause and to contemplate so that they may be illumined and benefit from the marvels of the Compassionate's mercy and the effusions of the Sublime Presence with the illuminations of the sun of meanings. The reason that has deprived all people from meeting God and has preoccupied them with other than Him is that they have deemed their delusions to be sufficient and have been content with what they have heard from the likes of themselves. They have walked the perilous paths of imitation and have been deprived of the paths of abstraction. When the divine command appeared like a radiant dawn and was manifest, some have been veiled from perceiving it. The reason is that they have contaminated their ears and hearts with the pollution of the words of people. Otherwise, if the observer is aligned with the true measure of divine knowledge, they will never be deprived of the path of guidance. Observe your own state; matters are of two kinds: either those who articulate are connected with divine power, or not. If they do not confess, we have no words for these souls, for they are considered among the previous religions who have deemed the Hand of God to be chained, as the Lord of Glory has informed with His exalted statement: "God's hand is chained."

4 And if they acknowledge the novelties of divine power, then abstaining from such questions will be void and futile, because incapacity is the status of creation. That eternal essence has always been seated on the throne of power and authority. And if He wills with a word, He can elevate all those on Earth to the heavens, and with another word, He can degrade the rank of creation. And no one has the right to say why and for what. Whoever says so has disbelieved in God, turned away from His power, fought with himself, contested His authority, and is among the polytheists in the tablets of glory and preservation. Likewise, He is capable that whenever He wills, He manifests the appearance of His Self among creation. And at the time of His appearance, one must seek from His manifest Self the argument and proof. If He comes with the argument that has always been among people, any other hesitation is false. In fact, if all those in the heavens and the Earth hesitate for less than a moment, they will be considered among the dwellers of hell, even if they all claim guardianship. He honors whomever He wills and humiliates whomever He wishes. He is not questioned for what He does.

5 Consider fairly the situation if a soul appears endowed with all divine qualities and, furthermore, brings forth evidence that has always been used to establish the faith among people and confirm the command of God among His creatures. Now, if another soul turns away from such a divine manifestation, and not just turns away but also takes up arms to kill them, what is the judgement on such a soul? Say, the judgement lies with God; He judges as He wills, just as He has always judged truthfully. Yet, most people are unaware. Has such an act ever been permissible in any dispensation or faith? No, by the essence of the Most Merciful, the Compassionate. If they say this manifestation should not appear, as the idolaters have claimed, then the power and will of God becomes contingent upon the will of His creation. Exalted is He above such a notion. Just like during the advent of Moses, all people, learned and ignorant, became deprived of the truth due to these baseless, meaningless statements. They deviated from the loftiest stations of eternity to the depths of annihilation, thinking themselves to be firmly established on the highest seat of faith. How terrible is what they presume about themselves, for they are among the deluded.

6 In the Mother of Tablets it is mentioned: Turn your gaze away from us towards God, and look with the truth at what appears from Him. For apart from Him, everything is mere nothingness, has been and will be. If today, all that is in the heavens and the earth were to be expressed in words, which are a hundred thousand ranks superior to the words of the Quran, and if anyone hesitates at the least in this matter, they are considered deniers in the sight of God. Do not attribute to the Almighty any comparison, relation, resemblance, or contradiction. Everything, in relation to their knowledge of Him, has been and will be honored and esteemed. The beauty of the All-Glorious is established on the Throne of the All-Merciful, and the rays of the sun of His grace shine upon all things. All that is in the dominion stand humbly in a single plane before His grace. No atom gains any honor or increase over another atom except by precedence in knowledge of God and meeting Him. Blessed is the one who knows Him by Himself and secludes himself from all else.

### People Are Astonished at the Transformation of Names

7 O Ali, heed the call of God and enter the sanctuary that has always been, and will always be, sanctified among the names. Lest you be deprived of any name of beauty and sovereignty that by the will of His pen has created the celestial realm of names, for God is the one and only God. The purpose of this utterance is that perhaps you and a select few might tear the veils and enter the beloved holy sanctuary that has been sanctified from the conjectures and illusions of the worshippers. Verily, He is exalted above the approach or avoidance of creation and sanctified above the worlds. Is it fitting, during the rise of the sun, for someone to question how the light of the stars can be captured, when one observes that the light of the sun has rendered their luminance nonexistent? In this station, the stars seek the darkness of the night, avoiding the light of day, for the splendor and radiance of the stars are visible at night, and by the illumination of daytime they become nonexistent and lost. So glorified is He beyond similitudes and parables. His beauty's light has always been radiant, and no one shares with Him. All else have been created in earthly possibilities by His permissive will and will return to Him. He, in His unapproachable and exalted station, has always been and will always be sanctified above all. It is astonishing that people marvel and are puzzled at the transformation and alteration of names, when they all observe with their outward eyes the change and transformation of the manifestations of names. Yet, due to veils of illusion and words of polytheism, they remain so veiled that they have become heedless of what they observe with their outward eyes.

8 Observe, they have become heedless. O seeker, do not consider the Divine Names and Attributes to be imaginary. Know that all things created between the earth and the heavens are manifestations of the Names and the study of the Attributes of the Most High. The ultimate purpose is that man was created in relation to Him in the highest rank and greatest station. If you do not see any difference in the creation of the Merciful and the study of the Glorious Act, blessed is the one who soars in this air in which the wings of the doubters have not soared. Now observe in all these manifestations of the Divine Names, from trees and branches and twigs and fruits, as well as in herbs and flowers, and all that adorns the face of the earth; they initially show a degree of freshness, delicacy, and brightness. After some time, they all shed their delicate attire and return to the earth. How many types of fruits change in such a way that one avoids their smell. Verily, all, in rising and falling and change and transformation, except for the manifestations of the Divine Essence, are by themselves, for themselves, established and enduring. I swear by the sun of meanings that the Divine Tongue speaks in such a manner that most of the people have not reached maturity; otherwise, a door of knowledge would have been opened to the face of the servants, and all who are in the heavens and the earth would have observed with the ink of His pen from our knowledge towards themselves, established on the thrones of stillness. Due to the lack of preparedness of the people, the jewels of Divine knowledge and the secrets of Eternal wisdom remain preserved and concealed in the heaven of Divine Will until a moment when a word from it is not revealed. Afterward, the matter is in His hand; He does what He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. He is the All-knowing, the All-Aware.

9 If from this servant you hear, cast aside the feathers of limitation and imitation, and with the feathers of abstraction soar in this air of the sanctity of unity. So that you may sanctify yourself from conjectural doubts and insinuations of uncertainty, and see yourself illumined with the light of certainty. Listen attentively to the words of the Merciful, so that perhaps your heart may become purified from the murky dust of illusions that in these days have enveloped all who are in the domain. And turn towards the Greater Vision, and when you achieve this most sanctified, most secure, and purest station, you will observe that our aim in expression, which has descended prior to this pen from the heaven of Divine Will, has been and will be this appearance. It is He in whose grasp is the soul of Husayn, that greater than this matter has not been revealed in expression. Observe it with an illumined and sharp vision so that you may be informed of the aim of the sacred Divine words. And in all leaves, tablets, scrolls, pages, parchments, and books, He has instructed all people and has taken a covenant from all, that they should not, during the appearance, adhere to anything that was created and remain veiled from the soul of the appearance. For on that day, nothing will avail, except after His permission.

10 Buhá'u'l-Akbar (the Greater Revelation) says, "And anticipate the One who will remind you of God's Countenance, for you were not created but to meet Him. And He is the One who has suspended everything by His command. Beware, beware, during the days of His appearance that you do not veil yourself with the 'Unique Explanation', for that 'One' is but a creation in His sight. Beware, beware, that you do not veil yourself with the words that have descended in the explanation, for they are His own words in the structure of His appearance." Before this condition, ponder upon these words where the sovereignty of Names and Attributes lies. With these firm verses and precise words, no room for turning away remains for any soul, unless one turns away entirely from the Truth. Statements are the first creation, and what is below them is created in their shadow.

Similarly, Buhá'u'l-Akbar says, "Perhaps what you have asked about the elevation of His mention and the loftiness of His affair will come to you. There are those in the explanation who read these words, and yet they pay no attention to His appearance nor do they believe in God who created them by the appearance before Him, and they are asleep."

11 As it is observed, they all recite the Book of God and write it day and night, and yet they have not sensed a single letter from the Book. Rather, the purpose behind their promotion is nothing but the realization of leadership and its affirmation. Thus, testifies the Tongue of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and says, "From the beginning of this matter until before the completion of nine cycles of creation, it has not appeared. Every time you have seen from the sperm to what we have covered with flesh, then be patient until you witness another creation. Say, 'Blessed is God, the best of creators.'" In the same vein, He says, "This is what We promised you before we called you. Be patient until the explanation is completed in nine cycles. Then say, 'Blessed is God, the best of originators.'" He also says, "So observe the difference between the Qa'im and the Qayyum, then in the ninth year you will attain all good. Reflect a little on these words and also think about the difference between Qa'im and Qayyum. For this servant, who has entered from sorrows, is not capable of interpreting the words of God. By God, who there is no god but Him, the proclamation of God's command has compelled this servant to write this Tablet, so that perhaps a few lamps in the niche of possibility would be illuminated, and by the power of God, support this oppressed one.
