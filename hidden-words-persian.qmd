# The Persian Hidden Words {#sec-the-persian-hidden-words}

In the name of the proficient speaker.

1 O people of intellect and perception,

First, Soroush, the beloved, is here, O spiritual nightingale, do not seek meaning except in the garden of significations. And O hoopoe of Solomon's love, do not find a place except in the sanctuary of the beloved homeland. And O phoenix of eternity, do not dwell except in the realm of loyalty. This is your abode, even if it seems impossible, fly with your soul, soar high, and freely manifest the melody of your own mode.

2 O son of the spirit,

Every bird's gaze is upon its nest, and every nightingale's purpose is the beauty of the flower. Except for the birds of the hearts of worshipers who, satisfied with transient dust, have remained far from the eternal nest, and have become deprived of the flowers of proximity. What astonishment, regret, sorrow, and lamentation that they have passed by a goblet from the waves of the Highest Companion and have remained distant from the radiant horizon.

3 O friend,

In the garden of the heart, do not plant anything but the flower of love, and do not extend your hand towards anything but the dove of affection and longing. Consider the companionship of the righteous as a blessing and keep your hands and heart away from the company of the wicked.

4 O son of justice,

Which lover finds a place except in the beloved homeland? And which seeker, who seeks rest without a beloved, can attain tranquility? True lovers find life in union and experience death in separation. Their hearts are empty of impatience, and their souls are devoid of hesitation. They pass through a hundred thousand souls and hasten towards the Beloved's abode.

5 O son of the soil,

Truly, the most oblivious of worshipers is the one who engages in contentious arguments and seeks superiority over their brother. Say, O brothers, present your deeds, not mere words.

6 O sons of the Earth,

Truly, know that a heart in which the stain of envy remains will not receive the fragrance of holiness from the realm of my sanctity, for it shall remain confined to the realm of oppression.

7 O son of love,

From you, from the flutter of abstaining from nearness, and the threshold of ascending love, take the first step and stride another step towards the realm of transcendence. Enter the sanctuary of eternity and listen to what has descended from the pen of glory.

8 O son of glory,

Be active on the path of holiness and step into the realms of human compassion. Polish the heart with the essence of a pure soul and manifest the melody of devotion through the rhythm of your being.

9 O shadow of destruction,

Transcend the levels of humiliation and delusion, and ascend to the heights of honor and certainty. Open the eye of truth, so that you may behold the beauty of the Divine, and exclaim, "Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators!"

10 O son of desire,

Truly, listen: the mortal eye cannot perceive the beauty of the eternal, and the dead heart remains occupied only with withered flowers. For each companion seeks its own kind, and finds companionship with its own essence.

11 O son of dust,

Become blind so that you may see my beauty, become deaf so that you may hear the sweet melody of my voice. Become ignorant so that you may attain a portion of my knowledge, and become poor so that you may draw from the ocean of my eternal abundance.

To be blind means to turn away from observing anything other than my beauty. To be deaf means to listen only to my words and not those of others. To be ignorant means to seek knowledge only from me. By purifying your eyes, purifying your heart, and refining your hearing, enter the vast expanse of my sanctity.

12 O possessor of two eyes,

Close one eye and open the other. Close one eye, meaning turn away from the material world and its distractions. Open the other eye, meaning focus on the beauty of the divine Beloved.

13 O my sons,

I fear that you may be engrossed in the superficial melody and miss the divine grace. Return from the transient abode and turn your attention to the beauty of the flower, not being captivated by water and clay alone.

14 O friends,

Do not pass by the beauty of the transient world and do not attach your hearts to the earthly dustbin.

15 O son of the spirit,

When the spiritual nightingale is prohibited from expressing the secrets of meanings and when all are forbidden from the melody of the All-Merciful and the call of the Sublime.

16 O essence of negligence,

Alas, that a hundred thousand spiritual tongues exist within my speaking tongue, and a hundred thousand hidden meanings within my apparent tone. But there is no ear to hear, and no heart to comprehend a single word.

17 O companions,

The gates of the realm beyond have opened, and the abode of the Beloved has adorned itself with the breath of the lovers. Yet, most have been deprived of this spiritual city, except for a few. And even among those few, only a small number are truly witnessed, with a pure heart and a sanctified soul.

18 O inhabitants of Paradise, proceed!

Inform the people of certainty that in the sacred expanse, a new garden of proximity and divine pleasure has emerged. All the noble and eternal beings have gathered around that blessed abode. Therefore, make an effort to reach that station, seek the truths of the mysteries of love from its branches, and discover all the profound wisdom from its remaining fruits. The eyes of those who enter therein shall be delighted and secure.

19 O my friends,

Have you forgotten that truthful and radiant morning when, in the shade of the Tree of Intimacy planted in the great Paradise, you were all present in that blessed realm before Me? I spoke words of purity and you heard all those words, becoming captivated by them. And those words were this: O friends, do not choose your own desires over My will. Never seek what I will not grant you. When you sanctify the forefront, consider the state of that plain and that expanse, and let my expression be known to all of you.

In the eighth line of the lines of holiness, which is mentioned in the fifth tablet of paradise:

20 O sleepers in the bed of negligence,

Centuries have passed, and you have brought your precious lives to an end, yet the pure breath has not reached you from our exalted realm of sanctity. You are immersed in the depths of polytheism, while uttering the word of unity. You have considered me, the Beloved, as your enemy, and have taken your enemy as your friend. You walk upon My earth in complete joy and delight, unaware that My earth detests you and the things of the earth turn away from you.

If you were to open your eyes completely, you would find a hundred thousand sorrows more delightful than this joy, and you would consider annihilation better than this life.

21 O moving dust,

I am close to you while you are doubtful of Me. The sword of disobedience has cut off the tree of hope for you. In every state, I am near to you, but you remain distant from Me. I have granted you immeasurable dignity, but you have chosen endless humiliation for yourself. Finally, return and do not miss the remaining opportunity and time.
