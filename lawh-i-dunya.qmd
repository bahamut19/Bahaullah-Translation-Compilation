# Lawh-i-Dunya (Tablet of the World) {#sec-lawh-i-dunya .unnumbered}

1 In the name of the One who speaks in the realm of expression.

## Praise and Thanks for the Sultan (Naser al-Din Shah Qajar)

2 Praise and thanks befit the evident Sultan, who adorned the steadfast prison in the presence of the Most Exalted Ali and the Trustworthy, and adorned it with the lights of certainty, steadfastness, and tranquility. Upon them is the glory of God and the glory of those in the heavens and the earth.

3 The light, glory, magnification, and praise are upon the hands of His command, those by whom the light of patience shone forth and the decree of choice was confirmed for God, the Capable, the Mighty, the Chosen. Through them, the sea of generosity has surged and the recognition of God's care has raged. We ask Him, the Exalted, to protect them with His troops, guard them with His sovereignty, and assist them with His power that has overcome all things. The kingdom is for God, the Creator of the heavens, the Owner of the dominion of the names.

4 It tells a great news, O people of Persia, you have been the dawning-places of mercy and the sunrise of compassion and love, and the horizons of existence have been illuminated and adorned with your wisdom and knowledge. What happened that you rose against your own destruction and that of your friends?

### Upon Branches is Baha'u'llah's Glory and Favor

5 O branches (Afnan), upon you is my glory and my favor. The tent of the divine command is great. It encompasses all the parties of the world and will encompass them. Your day is the day, and a thousand tablets testify to you. Stand up for the cause and engage in subjugating the hearts and minds of the people of the world with the armies of the word. It must be revealed from you what is the cause of comfort and relief for the unfortunate of the world. Tighten the belt of effort, perhaps the servants will be relieved from captivity and reach freedom.

Today, the cry of justice is high and the groan of fairness is elevated. The dark smoke of oppression has surrounded the world and nations. From the movement of the supreme pen, a new spirit of meanings has been breathed into the bodies of words by the command of the true commander, and its effects are apparent and clear in all things of the world. This is the greatest good news that has flowed from the pen of the oppressed. Say, O friends, fear for what and fear of whom? The petals of the world are destroyed and become by a little moisture. The breath of gathering is the cause of the dispersion of imaginary souls.

### Bring Good Words and Approved Behavior

Conflict and quarrel are the traits of the despised of the earth. Bring the winning swords of the Babi party with good words and approved behavior. The good people have taken possession of the gardens of existence with a returning envelope. Say, O friends, do not lose wisdom. Listen to the advice of the highest pen with an ear of understanding. All the people of the world should be relieved from the harm of your hand and tongue.

### Oppressors of the World Have Usurped the Rights of Nations

In the most holy book, in the mention of the land of Ta, what has been revealed is the cause of the world's attention. The oppressors of the world have usurped the rights of nations and have been and are busy with the desires of their souls with all their power and strength. From the oppressor of the earth, what appeared that made the eyes of the supreme assembly weep blood.

6 O you who drink the nectar of my statement and look at the horizon of my appearance, what has happened that the people of Iran, despite their precedence in sciences and arts, are now seen lower than all the parties of the world? O people, do not deprive yourselves of the blessings of the Beneficent on this blessed illuminating day. Today, from the cloud of divine mercy, showers of wisdom and speech are descending. Blessed is he who is fair in the matter, and woe to the oppressors. Today, every knowledgeable person testifies that the statements that have descended from the pen of the oppressed are the greatest cause for the elevation of the world and the advancement of nations.

## People, Purify and Sanctify the Earth from Idols of Suspicions and Illusions

Say, O people, stand up for your own support with the power of the kingdom so that perhaps the earth will be purified and sanctified from the idols of suspicions and illusions, which are in fact the cause and reason for the loss and humiliation of the unfortunate servants. These idols are formidable and prevent people from rising and ascending. It is hoped that the hand of power will assist and rescue people from the greatest humiliation.

In one of the revealed tablets, do not be preoccupied with yourselves, be in the thought of improving the world and refining nations. The improvement of the world has been through pure, good deeds and satisfactory, pleasing manners. The supporter of the command is deeds and its helper is manners.

O people of Baha, adhere to piety. This is what the oppressed has ruled and the chosen one has chosen. O friends, it is appropriate for you in this life-giving spring to become fresh and cheerful from the divine rain of April. A great sun has shed its rays and the cloud of generosity has spread its shadow.

Say, the demons are standing in their ambushes, be aware and free yourselves from darkness with the illumination of the clear name. Be world-seeing, not self-seeing. Demons are souls that are obstacles and barriers between servants and their elevation and promotion.

### Necessary For All To Adhere to What Causes the Elevation and Promotion of a Just Nation

Today, it is necessary and obligatory for all to adhere to what causes the elevation and promotion of a just state and nation. The highest pen in each of its verses has opened the gates of love and unity.

We have said, and our saying is the truth, associate with all religions with spirit and fragrance. From this statement, what was the cause of avoidance and the reason for disagreement and separation has risen, and what has descended in the promotion of existence and the elevation of souls is the greatest gate for the education of the people of the world.

### Pride is for Those Who Love the World

What appeared from the tongue and pen of the early nations is in fact the sovereignty of that in this greatest appearance. From the heaven of the will of the sovereign, a step has descended before saying, "Love of the homeland is part of faith", and the tongue of greatness has said on the day of appearance, "Pride is not for those who love their homeland, but for those who love the world."

### The Soldiers are Good Deeds and Spiritual Manners

With these high words, they taught the birds of hearts a new flight and erased imitation and limitation from the book. This oppressed one forbade the party of God from corruption and dispute, and invited to good deeds and pleasing spiritual manners. Today, the soldiers who support the command are deeds and manners. Blessed is he who adheres to them, and woe to those who turn away.

7 O people of God, I adjure you by courtesy and good manners, for the supreme seat of ethics is first and foremost. Blessed is the soul that has been illuminated by the light of etiquette and adorned with the trappings of truth. Possessing manners is possessing a high station. We hope that this oppressed people may be triumphant, adhere to, cling to, and behold it. This is the firm commandment that has flowed and descended from the pen of the greatest name. Today is the day of the appearance of the pearls of steadfastness from the mine of humanity.

### Be Like the Flaming Fire of the Lote-Tree (of Love)

O party of justice, you must be like bright light and like the flaming fire of the lote-tree. This fire of love should gather different factions on one mat, while the fire of hatred is the cause and reason for division and strife. We ask God to protect His servants from the evil of His enemies. Indeed, He is capable of all things. Praise be to God, the truth, the exalted, the glorious.

With the key of the pen, He has opened the doors of hearts and hearts, and each verse from the verses of the house is a clear gate for the appearance of spiritual ethics and sacred acts. This call and this remembrance is not specific to a country or a city, but the people of the world must cling to what has been revealed and manifested, so that they may achieve true freedom. The world will be illuminated with the light of the manifestation.

In the sixtieth year, the herald of our spirit, may we be his sacrifice, gave good news with a new spirit, and in the eightieth year, the world became triumphant with a new light and a wonderful spirit. Now most of the people of the countries are prepared to listen to the highest word, which all resurrection and gathering is related to and dependent on it.

## The Red Book (Kitab-i-Aqdas) is the Cause of the Elevation of Servants and Building of Countries

It was revealed in the red book in the prison of Acre, which is the cause of the elevation of servants and the building of countries. Among these statements in it, which was revealed from the pen of the master of possibility: The greatest essence, the administration of creation, is related and dependent on it.

### Five Commandments

8 The first (commandment) is that the Ministers of the House of Justice must implement the Most Great Peace, so that the world can be freed from exorbitant expenses. This clause is necessary and obligatory as war and contention are the essence of trouble and hardship.

9 The second (commandment) is that languages must be narrowed down to one language, and this language should be taught in schools around the world.

10 The third (commandment) is that one should seek and adhere to the means that lead to affection, love, and unity.

11 The fourth (commandment) is that all men and women should dedicate a portion of their earnings from various activities such as trade, agriculture, and other works for the education and upbringing of children. This amount should be entrusted to a reliable entity and spent for the children's education under the supervision of the House of Justice.

12 The fifth (commandment) is to give utmost attention to agriculture. Although this point is mentioned as the fifth, it indeed holds the foremost place. In foreign countries, this point has significantly advanced, but in Iran, until now, it remains stagnant. It is hoped that the king may pay attention to this significant and crucial matter. If people abide by what has been revealed from the Supreme Pen in the Crimson Book, they will find themselves freed from the world's laws. Several prayers have repeatedly flowed from the Supreme Pen that might, perhaps, be the dawning places of divine power and the places of God's glory to be aided in implementing those (laws). Whatever appeared from the Supreme Will, will be expressed for the Face of God if it is sought. But where is the seeker? Where is the questioner? Where is the just one? Where is the fair one?

13 Every day, the fire of tyranny is kindled and the sword of regret is unsheathed. Glory to God, the great ones of Iran and the distinguished nobles pride themselves in their lower tendencies. It is a wonder upon wonders what is happening in these stories. This oppressed one spends his nights and days in thanks and praise to the Lord of creatures. What has been observed is that the exhortations and admonitions have had an impact, and the character and attitudes of this party have reached a level of acceptance. What has been revealed is the cause of the world's enlightenment, and it is the intercession of friends with authorities on behalf of enemies. Good conduct is the true testimony of speech. It is hoped that the good will illuminate the world with the light of their conduct. We ask God, Blessed and Exalted, to assist everyone in steadfastness in His love and His command in His days. Indeed, He is the Guardian of the sincere and the workers.

### Guidance for the Shia Party

14 O Party of God! The Supreme Pen has revealed the worlds and granted true illumination to the eyes. However, most of the people of Iran have still been deprived of beneficial discourses and blessed sciences and arts. Yesterday, specifically for one of the friends of this Supreme Word, it was revealed from the Supreme Pen that perhaps the people of aversion may be victorious with a favorable turn and understand the intricacies of divine principles and become aware. The opponents and deniers adhere to four words. First: striking at necks. Second: burning of books. Third: avoidance of other sects. Fourth: the annihilation of parties. Now, by the grace and power of the Divine Word, these four formidable barriers have been removed, and these four apparent matters have been erased from the tablet. He transformed lower attributes into spiritual attributes. His will is exalted, His power is exalted, and His sovereignty is immense. Now, from the Truth, glory be His majesty, we ask and seek that He guide the Shia party and rescue them from unworthy attributes. From the tongue of each one of that party, every day, curses are uttered and cursed with the very throat, which is from the daily food of that party.

### The Laws and Principles Should Be Established by the Sultan (Shah)

15 My God, my God, You hear the lament of Your Baha, and His outcry during the nights and the days. You know that He did not wish anything for Himself but desired the sanctification of the souls of Your servants and their deliverance from the fire of oppression and hatred that surrounds them at all times. O Lord, the hands of those who are near have been raised to the sky of Your generosity, and those who are sincere have been raised to the breeze of Your bounty. I ask You not to disappoint them in what they seek from the sea of Your bounty, the sky of Your grace, and the sun of Your generosity. O Lord, support them with manners that elevate their ranks among the factions. Verily, You are the Capable, the Mighty, the Bestower.

16 O Party of God, listen to what the heed of which is the cause of freedom, comfort, ease, elevation, and overall prosperity. For Iran, a law and principles are necessary and obligatory, but it is fitting that it should be established according to the will of His Majesty the Sultan - may God strengthen him - and the learned scholars and great officials. They should be made aware of it, and they should gather in that specific place, adhere to the rope of consultation, and determine and implement what is the cause of security, blessings, wealth, and peace for the servants.

If it happens otherwise, it would cause discord and turmoil. The principles of judgments that have previously been revealed in the Most Holy Book and other Tablets concerning sovereigns, just leaders, trustees of the House of Justice, the just, and the discerning, after contemplation, will observe the light of justice in its apparent and inner dimensions.

### The British Constitution Seems Good, But the Fear of God is Needed

Now, what seems good in the British nation's constitution, which is adorned with both the light of sovereignty and the consultation of the nation, is mentioned in the principles and laws set down by the Bab concerning retribution, which is the cause of the protection and preservation of the servants. Yet, it prohibits the people in appearance from committing disgraceful acts, but the matter that is a cause of preservation and prohibition in both the outer and inner aspects, is the fear of God. He is the true guardian and the spiritual protector. One should adhere to and cling to what causes the manifestation of this great gift. Blessed is he who heard what my supreme pen has uttered and acted on what he was commanded by the Ancient Commander.

## Mischief and Politics in Persia

17 O people of God, listen to the counsels of the One True Friend. The Divine Word is like a sapling, and its place of planting should be the hearts of His servants. You should nurture it with the water of wisdom and utterance so that its roots may become firm and its branches might pass beyond the skies. O people of the world, the greatest favor of this most Great Manifestation is that We have erased from the Book that which causes dissension, corruption, and hypocrisy, and We have confirmed that which leads to affection, unity, and agreement. Blessed are those who act accordingly.

We repeatedly advise and admonish Our friends to avoid anything that emits the scent of mischief. Rather, they should choose to flee from it. The world is ever-changing and the thoughts of the people are diverse. We ask God to adorn them with the light of His justice and to make them aware of what benefits them in all conditions. Truly, He is the Rich, the Exalted.

In a previous utterance, We have said that those souls who claim attachment to this Wronged One should be rain-showers of bounty and bestowal in times of giving, and be fiery flames in moments of taking life. Glorified be God, what appears these days is astonishing. As we heard, a person entered the seat of sovereignty in Iran and subjugated a large group of dignitaries to his own will. In truth, this station is a station of lamentation and wailing. What has happened that symbols of the highest dignity have chosen great humiliation for themselves? Where has integrity gone? Where has self-esteem disappeared?

The sun of greatness and wisdom has always risen from the horizon of Iran's sky, but it has descended to a station where some of its men have made themselves a plaything of the ignorant. The aforementioned person mentioned this party in the newspapers of Egypt and in the Encyclopedia of Beirut, which astonished the knowledgeable and the wise. Then he turned to Paris, published a newspaper called 'Urwatu'l-Wuthqa (written by Muhammad Abduh and Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī), sent it around the world, and even had it delivered to the prison of Akka. In this way, he expressed love and intended to make up for past neglect. However, this Wronged One kept silent about him. We ask God to protect him and illuminate him with the light of justice and fairness. Let Him say:

### A Prayer for Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī

18 "My God, my God, you see me standing at the door of Your pardon and bounty, looking at the horizons of Your gifts and favors. I ask You by Your sweetest call and the scratch of Your pen, O Master of all beings, to enable Your servants in a manner befitting Your days, and befitting of Your appearance and Your authority. Indeed, You are capable of all that You will. Witness to Your power, capability, greatness, and Your gifts are those in the heavens and the earths. All praise is due to You, O God of the worlds, and the Beloved of the hearts of those who know.

You see, O my God, the existence of poverty yearns for the ocean of Your wealth, and the essence of disobedience desires the river of Your forgiveness and Your bounty. Decree, O my God, what befits Your grandeur and suits the sky of Your grace. Indeed, You are the Most Bountiful, the Overflowing, the Commanding, the Wise. There is no deity but You, the Powerful, the Overcoming, the Capable."

### Blessed Are Those Who Adheres to Rightly Guided Scholars

19 O people of God, today everyone's gaze should be directed to the horizon of the blessed word "He does whatsoever He willeth", alone. Anyone who triumphs with this station will be illumined with the light of true unity. Those without it are mentioned and recorded in the divine Book as the people of doubts and illusions. Listen to the cry of the oppressed and preserve the degrees; this paragraph is necessary and obligatory for everyone. The oppressed, in all days, spoke the faces of the people of the world without veil or cover, that which is the key to the gates of sciences, arts, knowledge, comfort, wealth, and affluence. The injustice of the oppressors did not prevent the Exalted Pen from scratching, and the dubious doubts of the corrupters did not prevent it from expressing the supreme word. I ask from God in all conditions that He preserves and sanctifies the people of Baha from the doubts and illusions of the former group.

O people of God, the rightly guided scholars who are engaged in guiding the servants and are protected from the whisperings of the commanding self, they are counted from the stars of the sky of knowledge near the world's goal. Respecting them is necessary; they are flowing springs, shining stars, blessed sidrat fruits, traces of divine power, and oceans of eternal wisdom. Blessed is the one who adheres to them, for they are indeed among the successful in the Book of God, Lord of the Mighty Throne. The glory is from God, Lord of the Throne and the heavens, upon you, O people of Baha, and the companions of the red ship, and upon those who heard your sweetest call and acted on what they were commanded in this powerful, innovative tablet.
