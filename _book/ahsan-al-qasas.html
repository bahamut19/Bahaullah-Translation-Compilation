<p>Praise be to God Who has sent down the Book upon His servant with truth, that it may be a light for the worlds, blazing and bright. This is indeed the path of ’Ali, established in truth before your Lord, already ordained in the Mother of the Book, straight and true. And indeed, in the Mother of the Book, with Us, it is for ’Ali, and upon the greatest truth, it was with the Merciful, wisely ordained. And it is the truth from God, and upon the pure religion, it was inscribed in the Mother of the Book, around the Mount, recorded. Indeed, this is the truth, the path of God in the heavens and the earth. So whoever wishes may take a path to God in truth. Indeed, this is the firm religion, and sufficient is God, and those with Him, knowledgeable of the Book, as witness. Indeed, this is the truth, upon the greatest word from God, the Ancient, sent around the fire. This is indeed the secret in the heavens and the earth, and upon the wondrous matter by the hands of God, the High, it was truly written in the Mother of the Book. God has decreed to bring forth that Book in the interpretation of the Best of Stories, from Muhammad, son of Hasan, son of ’Ali, son of Muhammad, son of ’Ali, son of Musa, son of Ja’far, from Muhammad, son of ’Ali, son of Husayn, son of ’Ali, son of Abi Talib, upon His servant, to be God’s proof from the Reminder upon the worlds, compellingly. I bear witness to God as He bears witness to Himself, that He is the truth, there is no god but He, and the angels, guardians around the Reminder with justice, there is no god but He, and He is God, knowledgeable of everything. The pure religion is this Reminder, whole. So whoever desires Islam, let him submit his affair, for God will write him in the book of the righteous, submitted. And upon the pure religion, it was with truth, praiseworthy. And whoever disbelieves in Islam, God will not accept from him any of his deeds on the Day of Judgment, not even a little, on the truth, by the truth, nothing. And it is right upon God to burn him with the fire of God, the wondrous, by the decree of the Book, from the decree of the Gate, destined. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, watchful over the believers. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, a witness over the believers. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, knowledgeable of the believers. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, encompassing the worlds. And God will not accept from anyone any deed unless he comes to the Gate, prostrating through the Gate. The Ancient God, praiseworthy around the Gate. God has authorized you upon truth, so prostrate and draw near, for in a drop of water, the fire was, God the truth was, prostrated upon the earth in truth, witnessed. O assembly of kings and sons of kings, turn away from the kingdom of God, all of you, upon the truth, beautifully. O king of the Muslims, then support after the Book, our greatest Reminder, in truth, for God has decreed for you and those barefoot around you, in valuation, upon the path, standing in truth, questioned. O king, by the truth of God, if you oppose with the Reminder, God will judge you among kings with fire on the Day of Judgment, and today you will not find, apart from God, the High, on the truth, by the truth, any helper. O king, purify the sacred earth from the people who reject the Book before the day the Reminder comes suddenly by the permission of God, the High, upon the strong matter, severely. And God has written upon you to submit the Reminder and its command, and to make the lands subservient in truth by His permission, for you are in this world, upon the kingdom, merciful, and in the hereafter, among the people of the garden of pleasure around the holy, you were dwelling. O king, let not the kingdom deceive you, for every soul will taste death, it was by the truth, upon the truth, written from the judgment of God, and be content with the judgment of God, the truth, for the kingdom in the Mother of the Book, concerning the Reminder by the hands of God, was truly recorded. And support God with yourselves and your swords in the shadow of this greatest Reminder for this pure religion, strong in truth, upon the truth. O minister of the king, ease off from God, there is no god but He, the just truth, and remove yourself from the kingdom, for we shall inherit the earth and those upon it, by the permission of God, the Wise, and indeed, it was with truth upon you and upon the kingdom, witnessed. And we have guaranteed for yourselves, by the permission of God, to obey the Reminder with pure truth, that for you in valuation, in the garden of Eden, is a great kingdom upon the truth. And your kingdom is vain, and God has made the enjoyment of this world for the disbelievers, and with God.</p>
<p>Your sovereignty, Hasan of the lineage, has indeed been in truth upon truth from ancient times, and indeed, for us in the garden of eternity, is a lofty kingdom. We grant it to whomsoever we will of our servants, those who were in this cause with God and for His signs, supporters in truth. O assembly of kings, convey our signs to the Turks and the land of India swiftly in truth upon truth, and beyond its lands, from the east of the earth to its west, strongly in truth upon truth. O servants of the Merciful, indeed, God has not created you and has not provided for you except for a matter that was with God in the Mother of the Book, great in truth upon truth. And follow what God has revealed to us of the decrees of the Gate in that Book, submitting to God and His command, pleased upon the truth. And know that if you support God, He will support you on the Day of Judgment with the greatest reminder, on the path, a noble support. By God, if you do well, you do well for yourselves; and if you disbelieve in God and His intentions, we are, by God, beyond creation and sovereignty, rich in truth. O people of the earth, whoever obeys the remembrance of God and this Book, has indeed obeyed God and His allies in truth, and indeed, in the hereafter, he is among the people of the Garden of Pleasure with God, written. And indeed, we have set the mountains moving on the earth and the stars upon the throne, around the fire, in the water’s pole, from the presence of the reminder with God, the truth. And none of you will forsake another, and He is the Dominant over His servants, and He is God, knowledgeable of everything.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-scholars-surah-2">The Surah of Scholars (Surah 2)</h2>
<p><em>Surah of Joseph Verse 1: “Alif, Lām, Rā. These are the verses of the clear Book.”</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate,</p>
<p>Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the clear Book, Alif Lam Mim. That Book, from God, the Truth, concerning the Reminder, was revealed in truth around the fire. Indeed, we have made the verses in that Book clear, a reminder and good news for the servants of the Merciful, for those who are with God and His signs, faithful in truth, who do not compel their parents and deter them with truth from deviance at the edge of the Book’s knowledge as a mandate. Just, who was with truth harsh upon the kingdom, those who fear their Lord, for a day that was in truth harshly written in the Mother of the Book, we fear from the Merciful on a grim day, a name inscribed in the Mother of the Book, a day when no soul controls anything for another soul, and the command then is for God, the Most High, and God was over everything a Witness.</p>
<p>Indeed, we have made the verses an argument for Our word over you. Can you produce a chapter like it? Bring your proof if you are truthful with God, seeing. By God, if humans and jinn united to produce the like of a sura from this Book, they could not, even if they supported each other. O assembly of scholars, fear God in your opinions from this day, for the Reminder among you from Us has been a ruling and witnessing truth. And disregard what you take from other than the Book of God, the Truth, for you stand accountable upon the Straight Path in valuation. And God has made suspicion in all the tablets a clear sin. And perhaps God will pardon you for what you have earned for yourselves before this day, for He is Forgiving, Merciful to the repentant.</p>
<p>And God has forbidden you from ruling on anything other than the pure knowledge from this Book, without truth and exertion. And indeed, We have sent down to you this Book witnessed in truth, so you may learn from what God has decreed in our favor, far from falsehood. And you have in the valuation on the Straight Path a position accountable in truth, truly. God asks His servants about what they do in the religion of God without true judgment in that Book, concealed. Soon, God will show you the signs of the Reminder suddenly on Earth in truth, imminent.</p>
<p>O assembly from the People of the Book, fear God and do not be deceived by your knowledge, and follow the Book from the Reminder in truth, by God, the truth, no soul that follows it but follows all the scriptures sent down from the heavens from God, the Truth, and God is aware of what you do. And no soul that denies the Book but denies the Oneness of the Merciful and disbelieves in the prophets and the scriptures sent from the heavens in truth, and their abode was the fire by truth, and God decreed the judgment in the Mother of the Book, executed in truth. And if God willed, He could have guided all people, and God has made our signs clear to the worlds. And the Reminder is the truth from God in truth, and God was over everything Powerful.</p>
<p>And when people disbelieved in our signs, they were ungrateful to God, the Most High, and those who disbelieved will know their place in a valley of the confined, which God named in the Mother of the Book as Hell. And indeed, we by truth make you taste the heat of Hell and your replacement from the toxic fire, decreed in the Book. This is indeed the truth from God as a recompense for your stubbornness with our signs and the remembrance of God, the Most High. This is the recompense like what you were in misery with God and with our signs, and the command of your Lord, the Merciful, is truth, and the promise of God was indeed enacted in truth. Praise be to God who revealed the light from Himself upon our servant to be a straight path in the worlds in truth, and indeed, We reveal to you what God has revealed to us; you were indeed high in the Mother of the Book with God. And what is in the heavens and the earth is by truth, and God forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and He is God, Powerful over everything. Fear the day you will return to God, and there is no judgment but His; there every soul is recompensed for what it has earned, and indeed, We do not wrong a thing.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the Reminder sent down to him from his Lord and the believers, each believes in God and His signs and do not differentiate between any of His signs, and the Muslims say by truth, “Our Lord, we have heard the call of God’s Reminder and obeyed, so forgive us, for You are the truth, and to You is the return by truth, O believers ! We indeed do not burden you except with what you can bear, and the kingship was God’s alone, God wants to lighten your punishment and send His mercy upon you, and no soul has earned anything except we have written it by the judgment of the Book, preserved. Say, ’Our Lord, God, our truth, there is no deity but He, so forgive us with Your mercy and have mercy on us, for You are our Patron, and write for us the return to You in truth by truth, God, there is no deity but He, created the letter Alif strong on the command, God, there is no deity but He, has decreed the letter Lam for His judgment on the judgment of the Book, God, there is no deity but He, has made the letter Ra for the expansion of His command as He wills in the Mother of the Book around the fire, decreed in truth.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-faith-surah-3">The Surah of Faith (Surah 3)</h2>
<p><em>Surah of Joseph Verse 2: Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’ān that you might understand.</em></p>
<p>We sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an so that you may understand. Ta-Ha. God has indeed sent down the Qur’an to His servant so that he may teach people that God has power over all things. He who sent down the Criterion in Arabic, without any crookedness, upon His servant, purely and truly as a revelation to show you His signs and the interpretation of the narratives along the right and straight path. Indeed, this is the path of ’Ali in the heavens and on earth, uniquely true from God, the Most High. He is God, there is no deity but He, He has sent down to you this Book with the greatest Reminder, affirming the messengers and what God has revealed in the scriptures; there can be no alteration to the words of God, the Truth, and it is the truth in the Mother of the Book, inscribed around the fire.</p>
<p>This Book, if it had been from other than God, the Truth, they would have found in it much discrepancy. And glorified is God, our Lord, nothing is hidden from Him on the earth or in the heaven, and we have recorded everything in this Book by God’s permission, hidden and truly inscribed from God. And those who disbelieve in the exalted door of God, we have prepared for them a painful punishment by the true judgment of God, and He is God, mighty and wise. Indeed, we have sent down to Our servant this Book from God in truth, and made the verses therein precise and unambiguous, and none knows their interpretation except God and those of Our servants whom we choose, the devoted ones.</p>
<p>So ask the Reminder for its interpretation, for he has been, by God’s grace, knowledgeable of its verses by the decree of the Book. Our Lord, we praise You after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You, as You were capable and giving by truth. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the greatest Reminder of God, their wealth and their children will not avail them against God in the least, and they have no power apart from God; those are the companions of the fire, by the just decree of God, abiding therein forever and ever. God has indeed supported with His help whomever He wills among His servants, and we have indeed made the love of women, sons, and wealth appear desirable to you, all of which are barriers to death. And God has indeed made good provision for those who support the remembrance of God, the Most High, with their hands, their tongues, and their wealth, God the Self-Sufficient, and He is God, mighty and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>When the People of the Book argue with you about something, say, “I have no knowledge except what my Lord has taught me; indeed, I have submitted my face to God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.” And whoever is arrogant in worshiping Him by turning away from My remembrance, it is right for God to burn him with the greater fire, justly deserved by truth upon truth. And you desire nothing except what God wills for you; indeed, He has been knowledgeable and wise. And the polytheists among you say, “The fire will not touch us except for a few days”; when we gather them on the Day of Judgment around the fire, they will testify against themselves that the punishment of their Lord had been inscribed in the Mother of the Book from the Door of old. And sovereignty belongs to God; He grants sovereignty to whom He wills and withdraws it from whom He wills, and He is God, powerful over all things. And we indeed humiliate the disbelievers as they wish and honor the believers as they wish, and God has indeed placed the good in your hands by truth, and God has placed your hands in the Mother of the Book, raised right. And indeed, in the creation of the night and day and their intermingling, and the bringing forth of the living from the dead and the dead from the living, are signs for the greater remembrance of God. Thus, it has been inscribed in the preserved tablet with God, the Most High.</p>
<p>O servants of the Merciful, do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers who preceded you. And whoever meets God with disbelief in the Book and this Reminder, then from God he will have nothing, and the Truth Himself has warned you, and to God, the Truth, is the return of all worlds if you fear your Lord, the Merciful, about what your hands have earned from the work of Satan, then hasten to forgiveness from your Lord before the day you find your deeds present before you. And God knows what is in the heavens and on the earth by truth, and He is God, rich over all worlds. O servants of God, the Merciful Himself warns you not to say about God except the truth, and He knows what you conceal in yourselves and what you declare, and He has indeed been kind and merciful to His servants on the truth by truth. O people, if you believe in God alone, then follow me in the greater remembrance of your Lord so that God may forgive your sins, and God has indeed been forgiving and merciful to the believers. And we indeed choose the messengers by Our word and favor their descendants with the great remembrance of God, some over others by the decree of the Book, hidden. And we indeed have given you the judgment of the doors by the permission of God, the All-Hearing, and He is God, a witness over all things. And we indeed sent Our spirit to Mary and accepted the vow of the wife of Imran, dedicated by God, the Most High, and He is God, knowledgeable of His believing servants. And we indeed gave the prophet Zechariah the good news with Our name, John, affirming the word of God, the greatest; this is from God, and we make him by that a master and a keeper in the Mother of the Book. The creation of the worlds is like Our command; when we want to say to it, “Be,” it becomes, in the Book of the praised God, existing around the fire. And God has taught you the knowledge of the Book from the Criterion, the Gospel, the Torah, the Psalms, and what is beyond them from the scriptures, and you have indeed been at your Lord’s door at the point from the concealed ‘Ba,’ stopped. And we indeed have inspired you with news of the unseen and sent down to you this Book in truth, and we have forbidden you the impurities and made lawful for you the good things so that people may believe in your remembrance, hoping for the honor of God’s ancient religion by truth. And God was knowledgeable of all things. And those who think that they can harm you with something from knowledge have indeed fallen from the sky to a dead, uprooted earth, and God was a witness over all things. And God has made your being touched by our beings, and your existence a trinity of the light of God’s ancient essence, our Lord, and He is God, powerful over all things. And the polytheists plotted against themselves in your remembrance and will not harm except themselves, and God has indeed fulfilled His promise, and I am purifying you and causing you to die and raising you to God, the Truth, and you will judge by God’s permission on the Day of Judgment in what people differ in the remembrance of God, the Most High, and God was a witness over all things. Some from the city said, “We are the supporters of God”; when the Reminder came to them suddenly, then they turned away from our support, and God is my Lord and your Lord, the Truth, so worship Him, and this is the straight path by your Lord, so soon God will judge between people by truth, then they will not find in themselves any distress from God’s pure judgment, and the matter was decreed in the Mother of the Book. And when the matter reaches intensity, argue by God’s permission with the polytheists, and say, “Come, let us call upon our Lord, who is no deity but He, by ourselves and yourselves, and God is indeed the Truth, a witness over us, and He is God, knowledgeable of all things. By your Lord, if you confront the disbelievers, and God is indeed the Truth, a witness over us, and He is God, knowledgeable of all things. By your Lord, if you confront the disbelievers, people look to the edge of the sky, and we have sent down upon them by God’s permission a lightning bolt of firestone, and if not for your prayer, the earth and some upon it would have been burned, and God was powerful over all things. Say, O People of the Book, believe in a word from God, equal between me and you, that you worship none but Him, and do not associate anything in His worship, and do not take from among you some as lords apart from God; He is one God, like whom there is nothing, and He is God, a witness over all things.</p>

<p><em>The Surah of Joseph Verse 3: We relate to you, [O Muḥammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur’ān although you were, before it, among the unaware.</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>We relate to you the best of stories through what We have revealed to you of this Qur’an, though you were unaware of it before. Truly, We have clarified the stories for those who desire us at the door, loving and responding. And indeed, We have sent down the Book in truth upon truth so that people might be in accordance with the Name of the Remembrance written in the Book.</p>
<p>We have indeed sent down the Book to every nation in their language, and We have indeed sent down this Book in the language of the Remembrance truly and wonderfully. It is indeed the truth from God and in the Mother of the Book, decreed among the most eloquent of Arabs. It is the most eloquent among the most articulate, and it is the greatest talisman in truth, and it was in the Mother of the Book marked as a talisman.</p>
<p>We have indeed made you a sun over the worlds and a luminous moon, a chaste herald, and a strong pillar over the worlds, that perhaps the people would be guardians of God’s signs in truth upon truth. But the people were not pleased with the true signs of God, and the people were strangely against God and His decrees.</p>
<p>O servants of God, did not our servant show you the true promise concerning what God intended for you in the proper religion? And indeed, God has made the signs our signs, and concerning the matter of the Remembrance, the decree of the Book was written in the Mother of the Book. This is one of them for anyone who has a covenant from the Merciful around their neck, truly and rightly, and has entered into that gate by the permission of God, the Praiseworthy, pure and cleansed.</p>
<p>O people of the city, you are the polytheists against your Lord if you believed in Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and the seal of the prophets, and his book the Criterion, which falsehood cannot approach. Indeed, We have sent down to Our servant this book by His permission, just like it, if you do not believe in it, then your faith in Muhammad and the book before was indeed a lie witnessed by God. And if you disbelieve in it, then your disbelief in Muhammad and his book was certainly known to yourselves truly and certainly.</p>
<p>O people of the city and those around it from the Bedouins, what is wrong with you, how did you disbelieve in Muhammad openly and wrongly after his death? Did not God and His prophet take from you a covenant regarding the guardianship of His successor in many places on the earth truly and abundantly? If you believed in God, who there is no deity except He, then what is wrong with you, how do you judge for yourselves with other than what God revealed in His true book preserved?</p>
<p>By your Lord, if you do not believe in our remembrance and this book, then be certain that your abode is the fire wherein you will dwell forever, and you will have no helper from God the Most High on the day of judgment. Indeed, some souls among you have died in disbelief before, and you did not believe in Muhammad nor those around him after his ascension except you disbelieved in his successor. What is wrong with you, do you not contemplate the Qur’an as a true revelation? God indeed promises you Paradise and Satan invites you to your religion which leads you to Hell.</p>
<p>So whoever among you wishes may believe and whoever wishes may disbelieve, and indeed God is free of need from all the worlds. And indeed, the power is with God, the Almighty of old. O people of the city, fear God on a day when you will not be able to do anything for yourselves, and indeed the decree from us was written in truth upon truth. What is wrong with you, how did you disbelieve in God, your creator, who there is no deity except He, who created you and provided for you from His bounty, and indeed He has always been a witness over you.</p>
<p>Will you not then contemplate the Qur’an as a revelation? Will they not then contemplate the Criterion as an interpretation? Fear God from whom we take on the truth severely, if you were in what you were and do not return to the high remembrance of God truly and soon. Then God will show you in the reckoning a fire that has encompassed yourselves; there you will find no helper apart from God the Most High. Have you believed in something other than the true God, and God has always been a witness over all things.</p>
<p>Have you believed in something other than the true God? God has always been a witness over all things. Have you believed in two souls other than the true God, while God encompasses all things? O delight of the eye, strike upon the people of the city a decisive blow. God has decreed for one of them two elevated gardens around the door, each with trees. One garden is watered from two basins, and the other drinks from two cups. Both are by God’s permission, surrounded by fire and stopped at two waters. There are also two rivers in the land of the two Wests, with whales in one of the bays.</p>
<p>Then he asked his companion among the first two, “Which of you will take charge in the other two?” And in those two hours standing, a month on the disbelief with certainty for the souls themselves and the two souls thereafter, by the true God, then connect with the truth. Which of the two souls in the two parties was praiseworthy around the fire? Indeed, the truth was recognized in the Sacred Mosque, seeing the state in the greater truth. Have you disbelieved in the one who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned you into a man? O people of polytheism, why have you made your hardship with the door another door? The true God has indeed set your seat by the fire. The book rules, settled and released.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-joseph-surah-5">The Surah of Joseph (Surah 5)</h2>
<p><em>Surah of Joseph Verse 4: [Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father,&nbsp;“O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.”</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>When Joseph said to his father, “O my father, indeed I have seen eleven stars, the sun, and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.” Indeed, We showed him in the vision that exalted station. And indeed, We recount to you from the news of the unseen from the Book of God, the Preserver, witnessed. And indeed, with what We have found from our sincere followers, God has clothed it as our beauty, a shining shadow. And again, no, what God intended in the belly of the Book is nothing without us, truly beautiful. And the Merciful has specifically mentioned Joseph, the essence of the Messenger, in the fruit of the virgin Hussein, son of Ali, son of Abi Talib, witnessed. God showed him above the throne with the sensations of the heart, that the sun, the moon, and the stars were indeed prostrating to him, God the Truth, witnessed.</p>
<p>When Hussein said to his father one day, “Indeed, I have seen eleven stars, and the sun and the moon, I saw them encompassing me in truth, prostrating to the ancient God.” God, who there is no deity but He, speaks the most truthful speech in truth, wonderfully. Perhaps the people were patient with the signs of their Lord in truth. Praise be to God who has interpreted Hussein’s vision in truth on the land of the heart, around the truth, witnessed. And God has decreed his testimony by the testimony of monotheism by himself about himself in truth, accepted because God has witnessed him by Himself with the testimony of monotheism from himself on the truth, witnessed.</p>
<p>And indeed, the Wise has informed about the secret of his vision in what has been revealed in the Criterion to His beloved, hidden. Indeed, the Qur’an of dawn was witnessed. And indeed, the stars of the throne prostrated in the Book of God for the killing of Hussein in truth upon truth, and their number was in the Mother of the Book, eleven. He is God who has placed monotheism in the realities of things, from His rays, in truth, willingly and unwillingly. And He is the one who has created the letters by Himself in truth as an example. And He is the one who has determined the letters of identity for His narrative in the greatest truth, eleven. And He is the one who has made the Imams the word of monotheism in the written line. And He is the one who has decreed the prostration of the sun, the moon, and the stars in the Mother of the Book by the decree of the Book, written. God, who there is no deity but He, and indeed your patron the truth is the most truthful of speakers in narrative.</p>
<p>And God intended by the sun Fatimah, and by the moon Muhammad, and by the stars the Imams of truth in the Mother of the Book, known. They are the ones who weep for Joseph by the permission of God, the truth, prostrating and standing. And the people weep like the shade of shelter for Hussein by the permission of God, the truth, prostrating equally. And whoever prostrates other than the Merciful or associates anything with God in worship, it is rightful upon God to admit him into the fire, abiding therein forever. Indeed, this is the true recompense from your Lord for what you were stubborn against our Lord’s signs. God, who there is no deity but He, the truth, and God was the Lord of the worlds, worshipped in truth.</p>
<p>And indeed, the innovations of the signs, the hours, the souls, and the horizons are signs for the first of understanding among you, who were witnesses by the high remembrance of God. Fear God and do not say in the greatest remembrance of God anything other than God, for indeed, We have taken His covenant from every prophet and his nation by His remembrance, and We did not send the messengers except with that valuable covenant. And We do not rule by truth anything except after His covenant in that greatest gate. Thus, God will unveil the cover from your sights at the appointed time; there you will be intensely looking at the high remembrance of God.</p>
<p>And the polytheists said, “Indeed, we have wronged ourselves after what God Himself warned us in His Book, and you were that day stopped in the hub of the fire.” There, you cannot escape, and when you ask for water from the owner, he will surely make you taste the water in the best part of the fire, hotter upon hot, and water from the best of the bitter tree. When you drink a drop of it, your limbs will be severed from your bodies, and you will wish for death, but God has not decreed that for you as recompense for your association with God in this world. And indeed, God was encompassing over everything.</p>
<p>And those who fulfill the covenant of God and do not purchase anything from the signs with anything false, those are on guidance from the high remembrance of God, and those are truly the companions of the garden in the Book of God, and indeed, the decree was written in the Mother of the Book. Those who believe in God and His signs in truth sincerely, God will reward them on the Day of Resurrection with double the reward and a good return in truth elevated. Indeed, this is the true recompense from your Lord, a plentiful reward. And indeed, this is the paradise God has decreed as recompense for your deeds, for what you have done in the religion of God, praiseworthy in truth. Do you think that other than our remembrance this is the truth from God, and it was not from God on the truth, or do you say upon God the lie? How often do you disbelieve in the praiseworthy God openly?</p>

<p><em>From the Surah of Joseph Verse 5: He said, “O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan. Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>He said, “O my sons, do not recount your visions to your brothers, lest they plot against you. Indeed, Satan is a clear enemy to man.” Remember the mercy of your Lord, His servant Ali, and indeed, We have revealed the Book to Our servant so that people may bear witness to the remembrance of God the Most High in this matter. And God did not intend anything from the servants on this day except by His true judgment as a revelation. If you love God, then follow Him; God will love you, and indeed the reward for remembering God the Great has been inscribed in His book by the hands of truth.</p>
<p>Whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see its full reward on the Day of Judgment, truthfully and abundantly given. And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil shall taste the fire named by the ancient God as bitter by the permission of God. And Ali said, “O my sons, do not tell of what God has shown you of your affairs to your brothers, out of mercy and patience for themselves.” God the Most High is just, and He is God, mighty and praiseworthy. If you inform them of your affair in any part of what God has decreed for you, they will plot against you to kill themselves in the love of God, excluding your true self as a witness.</p>
<p>And God willed, as He pleased, that your face should be bloodied on the ground, truly and deeply stained. And God willed, as He pleased, to see your hair dyed with your blood and your self on the ground, slain unjustly by the truth. And your body on the ground, naked, and God willed, as He pleased, to see your daughters and your women in the hands of the disbelievers, unjustly captives. And God willed, as He pleased, to see the faces of your followers before you, reddened with the dye of themselves and their bodies on the ground, wounded and unjustly cast down.</p>
<p>So do not reveal anything of what God has decreed in your essence from the secret of the hidden testimony to yourself, even a little of the word. If you inform them of your secret affair in truth, even a little, there they will sacrifice themselves for the love of God, longing for God. And God was, with His servants, truly and truly compassionate. God, who there is no deity but He, speaks the most truthful speech, wonderfully. Perhaps people were with the signs of their Lord, the Merciful, on the right path, in the ways of the door, praisefully grateful.</p>
<p>And indeed, the brothers of Joseph knew from the secret of his affair a letter on the secret, profoundly secret, and thus the traditions of the prophets and the martyrs have proceeded to be killed in His cause, and God was over everything truly a witness. And the devil’s disbelief proceeded after killing Joseph, and that matter was with the Merciful and His chosen ones and in all the tablets, truly and truly cursed. And after his disbelief, he intended greatly on the Greatest Word unjustly, but God will soon remove his concern and cast him into the sea of darkness, where some layers are above others, plotting.</p>
<p>And those who wronged us will know that they do not precede us in the knowledge of the Book, not even a letter, and we were encompassing over all worlds with God the Most High, truly and truly. And God has counted you in the Mother of the Book among the five hidden ones, secretly secret. And God has taught you knowledge that those before you could not encompass. And indeed, we have taught you the knowledge of innovations from the Merciful, innovatively, and what God did not will was not by anything, and it was not in the knowledge of your Lord by anything.</p>
<p>And God has spoken truly and truly, “Did you not pledge to you, O servants of God, in our true covenant on the truth, a heavy covenant, do not say about God the truth except the greatest truth, affirming and peacefully?” And indeed, we have taken from you in the sight of God a firm covenant, out of love for our followers from the Wonderful, on the truth, and the command was from God the Most High, great. And God intended for you in this book a command on the greatest truth, imposed, and people were in negligence and discord in this greatest gate from our great command, unjustly, and He is God, High, Great.</p>
<p>God is independent of you, and He is God, encompassing everything. Has not the remembrance of God reached you, O servants of God, repeatedly from our great command? O people of the earth, fear God in that cultivated leaf from the single tree, for indeed, by the truth, it is a right as He is God and His allies on the right, truly, and God was over everything a witness. And God has decreed among the servants that you worship none but Him around the gate, and this is the pure religion on the path of equity, beneficently.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-the-visit-surah-7">The Surah of the Visit (Surah 7)</h2>
<p><em>The Surah of Joseph Verse 6: And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives [i.e., events or dreams] and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise.”</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>Thus, your Lord chooses you and teaches you the interpretation of narratives and completes His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is all-knowing, wise. God has revealed the Criterion to our mention, that it may be a bearer of good news to all the worlds along the equator and a warner. Indeed, We have completed Our favor upon the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth with the bounty of the remembrance truly and justly as a grace.</p>
<p>And God has placed the greatest of blessings on this day of yours, the remembrance of God the Most High, and God was a witness over everything. Thus, We have chosen you truly and taught you from the interpretation of the Book, what is not befitting anyone but you. You have been foremost in response to God the Most High, truly and rightfully mentioned. And God has chosen Hussein from His servants and made him truly and justly an Imam and a martyr. And he preceded his brothers in the knowledge of the Merciful, a convincing letter on the secret, what was in the hidden line of the secret of concealment.</p>
<p>And God has completed His favor on Hussein and his successors by making their favor like His own favor over all the worlds. He is the one who accepts from his visitor by visiting the truth for himself and has called the martyrs to His throne in truth, there is no deity but He, without likeness, truly. And God has not decreed for His secret on a letter of the letters interpretatively. He is the one who promised the visitors to meet Himself, and God’s promise was truly enacted.</p>
<p>He is the one who decreed the square in the paths of the visit in the visit truly and justly, and the matter was decreed in the Mother of the Book around the fire. He is the one who chose for Joseph a letter from the secret and for his parents before a letter from the line around the secret, concealed. He is the one who was and nothing was with Him, truly and rightfully mentioned. He is the existing one, who always was and will be in His rank, nothing exists truly and justly.</p>
<p>He is the one who has taught you from the interpretation of the narratives as you wished by what We wished, truly and justly from the truth, wonderfully. He is the one who has raised the geometry from that gate, honoring the gate, and God was over everything powerful. So follow what God has revealed to you in the matter of the remembrance openly with the greatest truth and in the greatest secret, for We do not wish for your souls but the gardens of Eden around the pleasure, existing truly.</p>
<p>We show you the truth; We do not want from you any reward for the greatest gate and on the truth, gratefully, except patience and helplessness. God the Most High, and He is God, mighty and praiseworthy. And the lands have been filled from the bounty of your Lord, the Merciful, generously. And We have extended to you as We began you, and we only confirm it in the Book of God, your denial of Our signs from the remembrance often. Why do you not remember for yourselves a reminder from God the truth a little?</p>
<p>How do you disbelieve in God, and you were dead not knowing anything from the knowledge of the Book, truly and justly? And He is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, then will revive you if He wills. Your possession and the greatest word from God, do you not fear from a day when a patron will not benefit a patron anything, and the kingdom on that day is truly for the Merciful, for the family of God, and for their followers, as was written in the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>On the day when the Spirit and the angels stand around the remembrance by the permission of God the truth, arrayed in a row, no one will enter Paradise except he who has a strong covenant from God on his neck. And those who disbelieved, who spoke the wrongful word unjustly, will not enter Paradise except those who were Jews or Christians. By God, those are their wishful thinking of polytheism, and the judgment was known in the Mother of the Book. Thus, they will face from the Merciful a command in truth, truly witnessed.</p>
<p>Those will not be able to and will not be able to benefit themselves apart from the remembrance, neither harm nor benefit, except by the permission of the Merciful who spoke truly in His Book from our servant, a letter on the truth, repentantly. Do people think that we were distant from the creation? No, on the day we unveil the leg above their legs, that people may see the Merciful and His remembrance in the land of gathering soon. They will say, “Would that we had taken a path with the door. Would that we had not taken any men besides the door unjustly, alas! The remembrance has come to us from before us and from behind us and from our left, and we were veiled from it.”</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>Indeed, in Joseph and his brothers, there were signs for those who ask.</em></p>
<p>Praise be to God who has exalted His signs in His noble book, and He is God, watchful over everything. Indeed, We have clarified the signs in that book for the people of understanding, those who have been solitary around the door. And God has exalted Joseph by our name, and God has made him a guardian in the book, stationed around the fire. And God has made Joseph and his brothers the word of monotheism and the Merciful has measured them with twelve letters. This word was in the Mother of the Book at your Lord, inscribed around the line, inscribed.</p>
<p>And God has specially attributed to Joseph the letter ‘Ha’ as a reward for his standing by the Merciful on the known day, truly and justly on earth, solitary. And God has made monotheism for those who inquire at our door and for those standing in the depths of uniqueness by our permission, those who have been upright around the door. God, who there is no deity but He, the truth, and He is God, worshiped in truth upon truth.</p>
<p>Fear, O servants of God, the day you were around the fire by the permission of God the Most High, questioned. Not a word do you utter but with it is an angel from us, by the remembrance, watchful. And our servant was never hidden on the day from the sincere servants of God. And God has created for you the Day of Resurrection as an appointed time of justice. The Day of Decision placed the balance by the permission of God before us, justly and upon the correct path, balanced.</p>
<p>Soon He will inform you on this day about what you have been doing in the religion of God, openly and secretly. O servants of God, have we not entrusted to you in our word, truly and clearly, a covenant not to say in our servant any of the letters deceitfully? So exalted is He who there is no deity but He, and He is God, encompassing the worlds. God did not intend from your creation but the prostration of the Merciful intended in this door’s path.</p>
<p>He is the one who created the believers from water that was in the Mother of the Book, fresh, and He is the one who made the realities of the disbelievers from salty water that was in the root of Hell, bitter. And God has made the realities of the believers, the signs of our servant, elevated for those who want God and His allies from before the door, sincerely chosen. And we have made our word on earth a witness by the believers. And we have raised him to the station of holiness, visible. And we have brought him close to us and made him firm in truth.</p>
<p>God has stationed him on the straight path in pure truth, commanded. And God has fixed him on the balance from the judgment of the Book, decreed by the Book, a lesson for those who are insightful at God the Most High, in truth. And a reminder for those who are around the fire by the wise fire, patient. And God intended by the name of Joseph our high word, which was witnessed around the fire. He is the one who sends upon you His signs by the permission of God, fearful in truth, truly monastic.</p>
<p>A reminder for whoever wishes to remember or fears the Merciful in the just judgment, which was truly decreed. And He is the one who has taught you in His signs the origins of the hereafter, perhaps people were content with God and His signs in truth. By the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is indeed the truth from us. And we have taken our covenant with the permission of God from all the worlds, for rarely do people say if God had sent to us a human in his absence, we would have followed him, and we would have been guided by his judgment to the truth, guiding.</p>
<p>Fear, O servants of God, the day the judgment of the book was decreed in the Mother of the Book. Did you not think in the remembrance of God the Greatest and our word a false thought? By your true Lord, you do not know a letter of His knowledge, what God has taught in the Mother of the Book, truly and justly from ancient times. So remember the remembrance of your Lord, the Merciful, at both ends of the day and in part of the night, as God has commanded you in His book before, and the judgment of God was decreed in the Mother of the Book.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>When they said to Joseph and his brother, “Our father loves you more than us, and we are a strong group. Truly, our father is in clear error.”</em></p>
<p>God has revealed the Book from Him, clarifying everything, a mercy and a good news for Our servants who have knowledge of the high remembrance of God, insightful of the Book. When they said the letters, “There is no god but God,” and that Joseph is more beloved to our father than us by what preceded of God’s knowledge, a letter hidden in the secret, veiled in the secret, absent in the line, elevated in the secret of the hidden, beyond what is in our hands and the hands of all worlds.</p>
<p>And indeed, We are a faction in what God intended concerning the matter of Joseph, the Prophet Muhammad the Arab, written around the line. And God has favored our father with His own grace and measured the hidden secret of His affair by what is in the hands of the worlds with clear revelation. The Merciful is established on the throne, and He is God, was over everything capable. And God has created things by His power truly and justly, and He is the one who invented the heavens and the earth and what is between them by His command, creatively around the fire, to teach people that the matter of God was in the Mother of the Book, existing around the fire truly and justly.</p>
<p>And He is God, was by His power watchful over everything, and He is God, was encompassing everything. And He is God, intended in the hidden of the secret on the secret of the line at the point of the door, interpretatively. And He is the one who made the selection from the door for the knowers truly and justly witnessed. O servants of the Merciful, shake towards this date palm trunk by the permission of your true Lord, God, who placed it in the Mother of the Book truly and justly from the truth, high. And He is the one who drops from it to your souls, moist on the truth truly, harvested.</p>
<p>For indeed, We have marked His remembrance by the Merciful in a day that was in the Mother of the Book anciently, and you in that day were not forgotten in the book, nor around the fire forgotten. And do not say how does one speak about God who was in the age on the truth truly, twenty-five. Listen, for by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, I am a servant of God, clear signs have come to me from the remainder of God, the Awaited Imam before you, this is my book, it was with God in the Mother of the Book, written truly on the truth.</p>
<p>And God has made me blessed wherever I was and commanded me with prayer and patience as long as I am alive among you on the earth. And those who invoke from God some of the narratives concerning the door on the door unjustly a little, do they think they can produce a book like this from God, the truth, witnessed on the truth? The truth truly says, “There is no god but God alone, He has no partner, and there is nothing like Him, and He is God, was by the truth on the truth anciently. If the humans and the jinn were to gather to produce a book like this truly, they would not be able, even if they were from the people of the earth and like them helped by some.</p>
<p>By your true Lord, they would not be able with a fraction of its letter, nor on its interpretations of some of the secret, at all. And God has sent it down by His power from Him, and people cannot match a letter of it by analogy at all, without comparison. These are the news of the unseen inspired to you, you were by God, the Praiseworthy, around the fire, and soon your Lord will come to you on the Day of Judgment, the judgment of truth raised from Him. Enter whom you wish into the mercy of God and turn away from the wrongdoers around Hell and let them in the fire on the truth, prostrate.</p>
<p>Do you believe in some of the book and disbelieve in some? Has God permitted this for you, or do you invent lies about God from where you were by the knowledge of Satan unjustly on the wrong by the truth, deceived? And indeed, We have sent down the remembrance, and God and His angels were over you by the truth, watchful. Fear, O servants of God, and be sincere in the religion of God, witnesses on the truth. Those who fear their Lord in the unseen and were by the Merciful and His allies around the door, chosen truly, so soon God will teach them their judgments of what they need for themselves openly from the truth to the truth soon.</p>
<p>And God has revealed to me if you love God, then follow me in this religion by the truth on the truth from the truth to the creation, uprightly. And your Lord, God, said by the truth, “I am merciful on my believing servants from the people of the door truly on the truth.” And exalted is God above what the wrongdoers say in the signs of the door, greatly high. Say, “The command of God has come, so do not hasten it, for the command of God was on the truth by the truth near, and the promise of God was truly enacted.”</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>“Kill Joseph or cast him to the earth; it will free your father’s face for you, and you shall be a righteous people thereafter.”</em></p>
<p>Mention the Greatest Remembrance in the remembrance of our Lord the Most High, praiseworthy. So exalted is He who has revealed the Book as He wished, with what He wished, and He is God, was over everything capable. And I was not except as We willed, and God was a witness over everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, We have favored Joseph and his brothers with signs from the secret of that great door, making it clear. If they said, “Conceal the sign of Joseph which God has placed among you to be upon the truth on earth, able men,” or “Cast him to the land of uniqueness so your father’s face may be freed for you, and you may thereafter be a people on the kingdom, pure with the hidden secret.” He is the one who has revealed among you a soul from your souls, and indeed, We have made him a human on the truth, noble.</p>
<p>And indeed, We have made the heavens and the earth signs for Our servant, and God was a witness over everything. Soon God will show you in the seat of truth His signs on the truth, truly great from Us. And indeed, We have sent down the signs in the scriptures, and God was knowledgeable of His signs and the remembrance truly and justly. And indeed, We have shown you signs of God in the horizons and within yourselves so that you may testify that He is the truth, and God has made the way for those who are by their Lord at the door, questioned on the truth.</p>
<p>And God has revealed this book to His servant to be a witness over the worlds by Our permission, truly and justly. And indeed, We have accounted in that book all that God has sent down to the prophets and the truthful in all the tablets, truly and justly together. And We have left from Our judgment in you what you have left from the Book of God, a letter on the covered secret, hidden. And people have lied about what they preceded us in obedience to the Merciful, somewhat, and God was a witness over everything on the truth.</p>
<p>Soon our servant will appear to you in a blindness of light for those who await the remembrance of God truly, morning and evening. Those are the ones whom God has made insightful in His pure religion and straight on the straight path. And from the people are those who say, “We believe in God,” and mention the Greatest, and God was insightful over His servants on the truth. They have disbelieved with their tongues after their souls were assured, and God knew them in their souls that they are disbelievers in God the Most High, newly.</p>
<p>Soon the fire and its stones will encompass them in the valley of Hell by the permission of God the Most High, soon. This was for you a recompense from God for what you were hypocrites in the religion of God, the just, and God was a witness to what you do. O people, has not the news of those before you come to you, and I warned you of the punishment of the Merciful truly and severely? Did not God promise you a paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth prepared for Our servants who were believers in the high remembrance of God and were pious in truth on the truth?</p>
<p>For you in it is what your souls desire by Our permission, truly and justly, a fresh bounty. So exalted is He who there is no deity but He, the Lord, and there is nothing like Him, and God was worshiped in truth on the truth. For indeed, We have warned you by the permission of God of a remembrance that you were deprived of without right. O people, aspire to the remembrance of God the truth, asking about the door, and to God the truth on the truth, devotedly.</p>
<p>For by the Lord of the heavens, God has indeed decreed your provision in this sky, truly and justly, descended and divided. What is wrong with you that you do not come out of your desires after the truth has come to you from God the Most High, great? He is the one who has decreed the sun as a light and the moon as a luminary that you may seek from His bounty the expanse of the goods of life, praiseworthy on the truth truly. And God has decreed the abode of the Hereafter for those who want God and His servant on the paths of the upright line around the fire, defined.</p>
<p>Know, O servants of God, that your Lord, God the truth, has delivered His argument to you for what you were with God and His signs on the truth, watchful. And only the believers are those who want in themselves nothing less than the Merciful and His remembrance on the truth, beloved. And indeed, the great secret has come to you and your openly from God for the great matter, wonderfully. Soon God will teach you of His command what no one before Him could encompass on the truth truly, expertly.</p>

<p><em>One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the depths of the well so that some travelers might pick him up if you are to do something.”</em></p>
<p>Praise be to God who created the heavens and the earth truly and justly, layer upon layer, to show people that their Lord, the Merciful, is indeed the truth and that He was over everything capable. And He is the one who created you from dust, then from a sperm drop, then from a clot, then a lump of flesh, then He brought you forth as another creation. So blessed is God, the best of creators, wise.</p>
<p>And He is the one who keeps you in the darkness of the womb and brings you out of your mothers’ bellies while you know little of the book, only a fraction. Return to your Creator and kill yourselves in the way of the true God, humbly; God the Most High, and He is God, was mighty, praiseworthy. And He is the one who has sent down these verses to you from Him truly, as good news for all believers. He is God, worshipped; there is no deity but God truly, and He is God, was knowledgeable about everything.</p>
<p>And He is the one who gives you glad tidings by the name of His servant truly and justly, and he was indeed in the Mother of the Book by God, high and wise. And He is the one for whom God did not make the secret of His name known before, truly and justly named. And He is God, gave him peace on the day of his birth, the day of his mission, and the day he is gathered on the earth of the heart among those around the fire, uniquely and justly. That is the secret of secrets from the Wonderous one who there is no deity but He, the Most High, and God was over everything capable.</p>
<p>And God has managed the matter in the door by His power, and the judgment in the Mother of the Book around the fire was decreed. And indeed, we have made you a great sign by the permission of the true God, and God was a witness over everything. And you are of the great prophets truly, you were witnessed around the fire. And indeed, we have prevented you from mentioning the door by the permission of your true Lord God, from what you were unrightly, improperly sighing. The day we fold the sky with our hands, the matter was decreed truly, and the oven fled by the permission of the true God, and God was over everything capable.</p>
<p>There, you will recognize from our command what you were far from unrightly. On that day, the believers will rejoice soon by the permission of God the Most High. Soon the believers from the people of the door will rejoice with what their Lord has brought them from the spirit, and the spirit in the Mother of the Book around the water was fragrant. And God has made for you this day on the land of the path on the bridge of fire, a meeting time. When one of Joseph’s brothers, and he is Hasan ibn Ali in the Mother of the Book, was great by the fire, by the ancient fire, he said, “Do not kill Joseph but throw him in the depths of the well of uniqueness around the fire, hidden.”</p>
<p>God intended from the well a blindness of the hidden in the air of the hidden secret on the secret in the Mother of the Book around the line, inscribed. People do not know what Joseph’s brothers have done, God in the right of Joseph the Most High was a witness. And God has decreed for Joseph a journey from the door to the door by the judgment of the Book around the fire, hidden. And God has made the visitors of Hussein a journey to the secure sanctuary by the permission of God the Most High, and He is God, was mighty, wise.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who travel from the door to God in the depth of uniqueness truly and justly around the door, solitary, those have found Hussein on the hidden edge truly, witnessed in the depths of the well. Those are the travelers in the Mother of the Book by the mention of the secret around the fire, inscribed truly and justly. And God has created Joseph and his brothers in the worlds of holiness from the drop of creation from that water, existing. When we found from Joseph a love towards the greater remembrance, we clothed him by the permission of God with the garments of prophecy by those who were his share in the Mother of the Book around the fire, decreed.</p>
<p>And we were not far from the truth about the worlds, and we recount to the servants the matter which people were deceitfully far from the truth about. God intended in your day today the greater word, this speaker about God truly at 25, wonderfully. While people did not believe in God and His signs truly, we preserved him in the depths of the well around the fire, hidden. And God has decreed that some travelers among you, who were in the Mother of the Book truly and justly in response at the door around the water, praiseworthy earlier, might pick him up. That was a judgment from God truly and justly, and the judgment in the Mother of the Book was decreed. And God has made you Muslims in His religion if you were with God and His signs truly and justly at that door, patiently.</p>

<p><em>“They said, ‘O our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph when indeed we are to him sincere advisors?’</em></p>
<p>As the mention of the Most High God, which has been spoken in the Mother of the Book around the fire, witnessed. God has revealed to me that I am God; there is no deity but I. I have decreed the merit of the remembrance as My own over all the worlds. And indeed, We have destined for the believers, by the permission of God, gardens among gardens in the land of divine pleasure around the sanctified House. And indeed, We have made Hell for the disbelievers from the judgment of the Book, encompassing by the judgment of the Book. By your true Lord, we have transformed the bodies of the disbelievers into other than their own in the coffin at the bottom of the fire, by the permission of the ancient God, a transformation as recompense for what they earned by their hands and they were ungrateful towards God and His signs before the door.</p>
<p>Do you believe in yourselves apart from the soul of the Most High God, truly and justly nothing? And God has made clear His signs for the people of the earth and the heavens truly and completely from the door entirely. And none believe in God and His signs truly except the early believers from the people of the door, a few. And most people have been polytheists with their true Lord, decreed by the Book by the permission of the Merciful. And none believe in God and His remembrance purely truly except a few from the first. And indeed, We have made you a support for the servants and a barrier for the lands, truly and justly, by the permission of the ancient God, intensely. By the true God, only those among the believing men and women who have the covenant of God and our covenant on the pure religion will follow you, purely on the truth. God, who there is no deity but He, entrusted to God your heart, for He is the truth, and God was over everything capable. And He is the truth, there is no deity but He, the Possessor of the great resurrection, intensely.</p>
<p>And God has offered our guardianship to the heavens, the earth, and the mountains, they refused to bear it and feared from it, but man bore it; this great mention of God was high, and thus it has been in the Book of God, the Preserver, under the name of the Encompassing, wronged, and in the hands of the people, among those who do not recognize it from the judgment of the Book, ignorant. And God has revealed His secret between the lines at the point of the fire, and it is only mentioned by those who came to the remembrance before the door, desiring towards the praised God, and God was over everything a witness. And He is the one who innovated your true self, appearing for our greatness on the judgment of the Book, decreed. And indeed, we have made you in the Mother of the Book by God the Most High, wise. And God has made you an example of Our likenesses truly without how from indication and definition, and God was over everything capable. And God has kept the secret of His servant in the pole of the fire from this Book, for what God has decreed in the knowledge of the unseen from His hidden secret on the line around the concealment, inscribed. Thus the Merciful will benefit you greatly in keeping our matter truly and justly as a reward.</p>
<p>When Joseph’s brothers said to their father in the sight of the Greatest, ‘Why do you not teach us the knowledge of Joseph, and we are witnesses of God, the Sustainer?’ And God was over everything a witness. And God has made us upon Hussein with the secret of uniqueness hidden around the fire, witnessed. And God informed about that sign, the judgment of the Most High and His sons on the judgment of the concealed uniqueness in the blindness of the identity hidden in the secret of the throne of eternity shining from the light of eternity, on the judgment of the Eternal around the water, inscribed. Thus the people disbelieved in God after Hussein stood on the land of Karbala, conveying about the station of love for himself, uniquely apart from the ancient God, and God was over everything knowledgeable. Thus the people turned away from God and from the reward of the two paradises on the disbelief of Satan, cursed, and they followed his partnership, the kingdom of Satan, displayed apart from the true God, and He is God, was mighty, praiseworthy. God, who there is no deity but He, truthful in the statement on the tongue of the door truly and justly, appreciated. Thus those who fought Hussein on the land of the Euphrates will be punished with the severest punishment and the harshest torment truly and justly, greatly. What is wrong with you, O troops of Satan, has not the truth come to you on its horse on the day of Ashura after it has conveyed to you the greatest command of God from Himself truly in the truth intensely? Did he not seek water for himself truly and for his youngest child, the infant, humbly on the earth at the source of the great command, weakly? O people of polytheism, is there not among you a soul that fears God for itself and conveys water to the water at the last breath truly and justly, God the true, a little drop? God knows the heart of Hussein and his heat from the great thirst and his patience in the God, the One, the ancient, and God was over him a witness truly. By the true God, we found his heart on that day hotter than a piece of iron heated in the ancient fire, and God did not witness for Himself except as He witnessed for Himself. So await the taking of God the Most High truly and justly on the land of Hell intensely. God killed a people who killed him at the height of pain to the extent of injustice. What is for these polytheists and ourselves, so soon you will see them in the land of the gathering, the power of the Greatest God in us truly. And we have judged upon them with the greatest fire truly, forever and eternally. And the truth by the truth said, ‘I will indeed fill Hell with them as a recompense for what they earned, God the true, and we will not judge by lifting the eternal punishment on them truly, by the true God, from something to the smallest part of the flake of flake.’</p>

<p>Blessed is He who there is no deity except Him, the one with the command in His hand, and He is God, was over everything capable. And indeed, We have decreed for every age, truly and justly, a challenge, and with every hardship, there is ease, truly and justly, so that people may know that the gate of God is the truth, and He is God, was a witness with the believers. And He is the one who has made the sun and the moon by a calculation from the fire, and We have ordained for them in the book of decree, in the stations of the measure, truly and justly, in the pole of the fire, an adjustment. The sun is not to overtake the moon in its course, nor the moon to overtake the sun in its light, and for each, a term is prescribed on the permission, and nothing exists except that its decree is in the Mother of the Book from that gate, inscribed.</p>
<p>And He is the one who has sent down from the cloud of His power these verses from an olive tree that was neither of the east nor of the west, neither earthly nor heavenly, upon those lines in the line of the equator, on the paths of equality, by the permission of the Merciful, around the gate, a revelation. O servants of the Merciful, if you believe in the true God, do not doubt the matter of the remembrance, for God, your protector, the truth, was over everything capable. And indeed, we have made clear the signs in that book truly for those of vision from the people of the gate, who were in the book of God, the Mighty, around the fire, entrusted. Those who believe in their Lord on the true value, and they are on the high path in this valuation, straight. They are those who do not set up another god with God and fulfill the covenant of the true God on the line of justice, praiseworthy. Those are the people of Paradise, by the permission of God, dwelling therein eternally, seeing only spirit upon spirit from the mention of the Most High God, and He is God, was mighty, great.</p>
<p>They are those who dwell on the red terraces around the gate, stationed, seeing in it neither sun nor air except that they meet the angels with the mention of the Most High God, on the name of the Living God, witnessed. This is the day God promised to entertain His servants, and they say from our side upon them, “Peace, peace.” O servants of the Merciful, did we not make the earth flat for you truly, and We have decreed the sky above you at the center of the throne, preserved? And indeed, we have created you by the permission of the ancient God, with import, truly in phases. Why do you not hope for the great God respectfully? Did we not make the sea raging for you? Did we not make the earth subservient that you may extract from it what you plant for yourselves from the bounty of the gate, the true God, appreciated? Why do you not believe in the mention of the Most High God truly and justly, a little? Why do you not hope for the great God respectfully? How do you deny, untruly, the signs of the praised God, derisively, untruly? Soon the fire will encompass you at the bottom of the coffin by the permission of God the Most High, and He is God, was anciently knowledgeable.</p>
<p>And indeed, God has prepared for the polytheists among you on the line of justice, a perpetual punishment truly and justly, painful. And when they said, Joseph’s brothers to their father truly, “Send our brother with us tomorrow on a secret from your hidden secret around the line, hidden.” And indeed, we intended to be with Joseph tomorrow truly and justly, with the truth around the fire, witnessed. And it is the day that God had decreed wherein we said to the greatest word on the squared secret truly and justly, the ancient God who there is no deity except Him, and God was over everything a witness. And when they said, “O our father, send him with us tomorrow truly so he may settle at the point of ice from the cold mountain around the point of connection with something from the point of fire from the mountain of justice around the water of bounty truly and justly,” and indeed, we were for him, by the praised God, truly preservers. And our followers will ask about us about the appearance of our matter on this greatest gate truly and justly, not from a letter from the knowledge of the book much, and indeed, they say, “Send him with us tomorrow to frolic and play, and indeed, we were on the truth truly in his matter on the great gate by God, the Preserver, preserved. God the Greatest from their patience at the gate to the gate at a point from the gate, God the Most High, a little, and indeed, we know what no one besides us knows, and the soul of the gate, and God was over everything on the truth knowledgeable. Do you not think about the creation of the heavens and yourselves thoughtfully on the truth truly with the truth lightly? Indeed, God did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them truly and justly in vain, aimlessly. He is God, the truth, who there is no deity except Him, intended from you that you worship only Him in the way of this gate purely for Him on the truth truly, and God was rich concerning the worlds. God, worshipped, there is no deity except Him alone, no partner to Him, indeed, He is the truth. By the truth, the god of all the worlds, if there were any beside Him on the truth, god, they would need untruly something with the truth, a third.”</p>

<p>Remember God in the greatest word, standing around the fire, witnessed. So listen to what is revealed to you from your Lord; indeed, He is the Truth, there is no deity except Him, and God was over everything capable. God has sent down the book, in it is the clarification of everything, and a mercy and good news for our first followers who were with the remembrance of the Most High God in that gate, hidden around the fire. Soon, God, your true patron, will show you His throne on the Day of Recompense on the line of the equator, and you will indeed witness that His power was equal over all worlds. There, people will recognize the true matter of God regarding the gate truly and justly, powerfully around the fire, great. And on that day, you will surely testify to yourselves in servitude, and you will not find for yourselves a bit of flake from some things truly and justly, an aid.</p>
<p>And what you wish, if you wished, but God has willed as He wished with what you wished in the remembrance of God, the Wonderful, truly and justly, from the point of fire, a revelation. And indeed, we have made the stories of the book by the permission of God from the self of power, who was in the Mother of the Book, knowledgeable. And God was over everything capable. And indeed, the command has come to you from God truly blessed. Do you conceal the truth and act with falsehood? What is wrong with you, do not you believe in God, the Praised, your Creator, and indeed, He was over what His servants did on the truth, truly great, a witness. Soon the Merciful will taste you in the valuation from a fire that was from the fire of Hell, blazing, a recompense for what you disbelieve in the signs of the book from God the true, what was revealed to our servant, and you were from it untruly, gasping and ungrateful.</p>
<p>O servants of God, has not the foretelling of the first come to you, and the judgment from God has been known to you on the truth, truly repeatedly, and He who is like nothing else and He is God, was mighty, wise. Did we not guide you to the ways of those before you, and you do not find in yourselves for our language on the truth, truly, a change? The way of God which has passed before you, so by your Lord, people will not find a change to the way of God, the Mighty. And indeed, we grant favor to whom we will by the remembrance of God, the true, who was in the response with the remembrance of the Most High God in the Mother of the Book, on the truth truly around the gate, mentioned. And indeed, we have elevated him from the holy place, a location on the truth truly, witnessed, to be a sign by the truth for those before you and after you by the permission of the ancient God, truly great, great. And He is the witness over you by our permission, so soon will God show you the greater remembrance in the valuation of what you earn for yourselves from your secrets and openly, by the permission of God on what the book counted truly and justly, preserved.</p>
<p>Be patient in God, for God was over the worlds, knowledgeable. Be patient, O remembrance of God, patiently on the truth in the truth, beautifully. And indeed, we have made you over the people by the permission of God the Most High, an overseer and a reckoner. So soon will God inform them on the distant earth by the permission of God the Praised, truly and justly, near. So by your Lord, we are closer to you than yourselves to yourselves. What is wrong with you, do not you see by the remembrance of God, the Impregnable, in the truth, seeing? The day He reveals the shin by the shin, people will call us by the mention around the gate, humbly for the truth truly, intensely. And that day is truly at your Lord’s; say then whoever wills takes me to God, his Lord, the Rich, truly and justly on that truth, a path.</p>
<p>So soon will the Merciful call you to prostrate to Himself, and you will not be able to. So from among you, whoever trusts God on the truth as a guardian, there the guardianship is God’s truth, and you had no helper apart from the Merciful on the truth truly. So soon will God show you His signs in the robes of the sun by the decree of the book on the paths of the gate truly and justly, near. The thunder glorifies His praise, and the angels from His fear, and He is God, was over everything encompassing. And there is nothing but glorifies with His praise, and you do not know from the knowledge of the book from some letters on the truth truly, anything. God, who there is no deity except Him, has revealed to me that He is the truth from God, and God has not decreed for our words in anything of the book on the point of the gate, a change. And He is God, the truth, was over everything a witness. And indeed, we have made the signs in that book by the permission of God the Praised, securely on the truth truly, irrevocably. And we do not reveal in it a letter of similarity for what God has decreed for the believers in this book around the gate, witnessed. And indeed, it saddens me that you go with him after what God has revealed on the truth truly in that book from Him, elevated.

<p><em>They said, “If a wolf devours him while we are a group, then we would be losers indeed.”</em></p>
<p>Taha. He is God; there is no god but He. There is nothing like unto Him. To Him belongs creation and command, and He has knowledge of all things. By the Lord of heaven and earth, this book is from God, the Truth. God suffices as a witness over His servant, in truth and with truth. God is the Self-Sufficient, and you are the needy ones before the Most Merciful. What God has decreed in this gate has been ordained.</p>
<p>So follow what God has sent down to you in His book, the true and pure truth, openly and strongly. Fear God concerning this gate with truth, and be the best helpers in the way of the gate of the Most High, the Praised One. God has decreed your matter in His book, in the secret of the book with truth, in the cycle of water. So pardon the people and forgive much. God is a witness to what you do. God loves those believers in this gate whose attributes are in the book of God, the Most High, with truth, in the cycle of fire, written. He is the One who has decreed your sustenance in the sky, apportioned if you desire God and the Hereafter.</p>
<p>By your Lord, the Most Merciful, God has not made for you besides the Most High a servant with knowledge of the book, the truth, from the truth, in the secret of the letter B, the All-Knowing. He is the One who has decreed your affairs in His mighty book, in the ways of equality, in the cycle of the gate, organized, so that you may seek His bounty and be grateful morning and evening, with truth, following the judgment of the book much. He is the One who has shown His signs to His servants with the permission of God in the glorious book, with truth, the Praised One, in the ways of equality, uniquely, so that you may learn from the pure mention of God and what you need in the way of His love, with truth, asking and being thankful.</p>
<p>God has intended in this book all goodness, in the name of the gate, in the secret of fire, decreed in the mother of the book. He is the One who has made our hearts the abode of His command and our breasts the vessels of His secrets by His power. God is capable of all things. He is the One who has confirmed our actions in His praiseworthy book to the discerning believers, in a decisive verse of the Quran. “And you did not throw when you threw, but God threw,” with truth, capable of all things. Those who commit sins falsely after the truth has come to them from God, the Most High, powerfully, we will burn them in the Hereafter in a great fire as a recompense for their evil deed, justly with its like. I am not unjust to the servants, with truth, even a tiny bit. Those who do righteous deeds in our remembrance, God will give them of His bounty, with truth, manifold and many times. God is capable of all things.</p>
<p>O people of the Criterion, if you are in truth among the people of the Quran and this remembrance is the truth, the same book, then return to it by the permission of God, your true Master. God has made the return on the Day of Resurrection witnessed. God has decreed what He has ordained, and the matter in the mother of the book concerning fire has been fulfilled. When the brothers of Joseph said to their father, “If a wolf devours him, we are surely losers,” on the earth around the fire, they were mentioned in truth. We have revealed to you what God has placed in the depths of this verse, with truth, so that people may believe in God and His signs, with truth, powerfully.</p>
<p>When they said, “The letters ‘There is no god but God’ are on the day of the beginning on the land of the heart around the fire, famous.” “If a wolf devours him, we are surely a group for him,” and God is powerful over all things. We have not made it in truth in the secret of Joseph on the land of the Euphrates around the fire, envied. We do not want you to be other than His caller on the earth, with truth, a witness. What do you think of us concerning the truth with God, the Truth? Loss. We have made, by the permission of God, our signs upon the worlds, with truth, around the fire, a guardian. God has permitted them in revelation and interpretation as they will, by what they will, with truth, praised. We have protected them from indication and from what you were away from in untruth, forsaken. God has borne witness, and God suffices as a witness with our signs, with truth. By God, the Truth, they only will what God wills, their Lord, in their secret and their openness, with truth. God is a witness over all things.</p>
<p>Know, servants of the Most Merciful, that we have made clear our signs in this book, with truth, in the cycle of the gate, so that people may be praiseworthy by God, the Praised One. Perhaps people may be thankful to God, the Most High. Say, “Call upon God and His name, the Most Merciful, in the way of the gate, for God has the best names, from the gate, veiled around the fire.”</p>

<p><em>When they went away with him and decided to put him in the depths of the well, We inspired him, “You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not perceive.”</em></p>
<p>Truly, God has sent down the Book, wherein is an explanation of all things, a mercy and good tidings for all the worlds. Praise be to God, who sent down the Book in truth upon our word, so that people might be mentioned in this gate around the fire in the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>This is Our Book, speaking the truth against you. Yet most people do not believe in God and His signs concerning this gate with truth. God is a witness over all things. O servants of the Most Merciful, We have given you glad tidings by God’s permission in the Greater Reminder from the ancient command, with truth upon truth, in this gate, a weighty matter. What God wants from you this day is obedience to God, the Truth, to His command, with truth, the upright truth from God, the Ancient, a reward.</p>
<p>Whoever obeys God in Our command, with truth, out of love for the Greater Reminder of God, and compliance with it, will meet God above the throne, pleased and well-pleasing. But whoever denies Our command rebelliously, in untruth, will taste from the Merciful a tree of boiling water emerging from the root of Sijjin, justly, a Zaqqum. He will have no covenant from God in Our hands, truly and purely. Whoever desires God’s covenant fulfills Our covenant in this Reminder of Ours, openly and strongly, with truth.</p>
<p>Fear, O servants of God, the day when the command comes to you from God, the Truth, suddenly and closely, with truth upon truth. On that day, people will possess nothing of Our kingdom except by God’s permission, the Truth, through Our servant. God is knowledgeable of all things. Except those who have Our Book around their necks in truth, who were responsive to the Reminder before, with truth and righteousness. The Reminder has fulfilled its covenant with those who came with truth to the righteous covenant.</p>
<p>Fear, O servants of God, the severe seizure of your Lord, the Most Merciful, in truth. God has prepared shackles and chains and fruits with a bitter taste and a great torment for those who disbelieve in the Book and Our Reminder weakly, and who believe in it only mockingly, falsely and vainly. These are the polytheists before God. They have no judgment from God except the fire of God, the Most High, severe.</p>
<p>Shall I inform you, O servants of God, of Our seizure upon the people on the Day of Decision, with truth upon truth, severe? Whoever turns away from God’s Reminder, adorned falsely, and in untruth, deceitfully, by the Lord of heaven and earth, We will make them taste on the Day of Resurrection by the judgment of the Book, with truth, the fire of the fire from the tree of fire at the bottom of the coffin, as decreed in the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>When the brothers of Joseph went with him to the land of oneness, secretly, around the inscribed line, they placed the letters of oneness, the letter H, in the depths of the well, secretly from the heart, around the fire, veiled. We inspired him, “You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs.” God will show them this letter in the place of secrecy around the gate, witnessed. The letters of oneness do not feel anything except God’s feeling in the place of the heart, in truth from their Lord. God is a witness over them, with truth.</p>
<p>God has veiled that word with a veil of the secret around the throne, hidden. Those who desire God and His signs in the ways of the gate, with the letter H, these are in truth around the fire, witnessed. God created Joseph and his brothers from the blessed tree of oneness, and people do not know their secrets, what is with God, the Truth, in the Mother of the Book, written around the fire. Do they not know that they do not act except by God’s permission, their true Lord? God is truly worshiped after denial and affirmation. The Most Merciful will not ask you on the Day of Resurrection about what they do for themselves; He will ask you about what you do in your secrets and your openness. God is knowledgeable of what you do.</p>
<p>God, there is no god but He, is the truest in speech, unique. God has ordained the share of people in the secret of all signs, except in weakness against the truth. God, the Truth, is truly submissive. God has made His own friends praiseworthy in their deeds, with truth upon truth. God is capable of all things.</p>
<p>Look, O servants of God, We have placed, by God’s permission, Our servant in the depths of the well, around the fire, veiled with truth. God has placed in this gate a secret upon a secret, hidden. You will soon know what you were ignorant of before, with truth upon truth, in the garment of the sun, by God’s permission, the Most High.</p>
<p>O believers, whatever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. God has made him wise with truth upon truth. God has made the Reminder encompassing over people, knowledgeable. God is capable of all things.</p>

<p><em>They came to their father in the evening, weeping.</em></p>
<p>Truly, this is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guidance from God, the Truth, for all the worlds. We have made it a guidance for Our servants, those who are in this gate, upon the gate, in truth and with truth, around water, witnessed. We have joined you with souls from Our own soul, who are pure in truth and with truth, around fire.</p>
<p>When the truth comes to you, follow it. God has made it in the Book from Us, in truth and with truth, accounted. We have made it with the knowledge of the Book by God’s permission, the Most High, from the point of fire, knowledgeable. We have confirmed it from God, who is without peer. God is capable of all things.</p>
<p>O servants of God, if you ask Him for something and He does not respond to you in truth, do not grieve, for it is by God’s command from Us, in truth and with truth, serene and praiseworthy. We have shown you the matter in your dream in truth, and if you had revealed it to them, they would have disputed over the matter. God, your Lord, the Truth, knows what is in the breasts. We do not change the condition of a people until they change what is within themselves.</p>
<p>Taste the torment of the blazing fire for what you turned away from this gate. Your Lord is strong and knowing over His servants. We will destroy the wrongdoers with the justice of the people of Pharaoh, with severe torment and great punishment. Do not grieve over those who deny in your presence and rely on God, your Lord. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, in truth. God is capable of all things.</p>
<p>O people of the earth, whatever you spend in the way of God, the Truth, you will find it in the hands of the Preserver, safeguarded in this gate. O people of the earth, believe in the light that God has sent down with me, purely and truly, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, for he commands you to associate partners with God, your Lord. God does not forgive associating partners with Him, but He forgives whatever is less than that for whom He wills. God is knowledgeable of all things.</p>
<p>God has decreed for the believing emigrants the forgiveness of the Reminder and the greatest pleasure, according to the judgment of the Book, in the judgment of the Book around the gate, decreed. We have decreed that some kin have greater rights over others, as God has decreed in the Mother of the Book, in the secret of the gate, inscribed. O believers, God has not sent down a sign in the Book, nor in the horizons, nor in the souls, except that people may know, in truth, that the Reminder is the truth from God. God is knowledgeable of all things.</p>
<p>O people of the earth, by your Lord, who is without peer, God has left nothing for Himself after the Reminder and this Book as a proof. Be patient with the truth of God, the Praised One, in this gate. Now, with the truth, the perishing ones perish clearly, and the believers live clearly. God is capable of all things.</p>
<p>O people of the Throne, hear My call from around the fire. I am God; there is no god but Me. Worship Me and establish prayer for the greatest Reminder, purely, without people. Your Lord is God, the Truth, the True One. Those you call upon besides Him are the companions of the fire, justly. The Reminder is the true path, the straight line, around the fire, upright.</p>
<p>O people of the earth, fear God and do not let Satan deceive you from the truth. The Reminder is the truth, with truth. You and those you call upon besides Him are the people of the fire, in the Mother of the Book, written. O people of the earth, have you not considered the creation of the heavens and the earth? If there were two gates from the Reminder, they would have been corrupted. God has managed the kingdom by His gate, the truth. God is knowledgeable of all things.</p>
<p>O believers, fear the Day of Truth. We have gathered you around the fire and will question you about what you have done with the Reminder. In truth, We will make the polytheists taste the heat of the fire with the greatest torment. We will give the patient ones the best reward in the land of saffron, by the judgment of the Book, from the judgment of the gate, a resting place. We have sent it down to the people with truth. People have no choice but to submit and accept. The Reminder clarifies the truth from God, the Most High, uniquely.</p>
<p>The Reminder is from God to give you glad tidings of His promise and to warn you of His vengeance. It is hidden in the Mother of the Book, in the secret of the Book, around the point of fire, preserved. The Reminder is before you, behind you, on your right and left, by God’s permission, with truth, so that people may be mentioned in the wonderful signs of this Book, around the gate, in truth. This has been a station for you on the path, clearly known. Fear God, O possessors of intellect, in the secret of God, hidden in the line of this Book, as God has decreed around the fire, veiled.</p>
<p>God has not asked you for any reward in this Book for the Reminder, nor for truth upon truth, except affection for near kin, inscribed around the gate in the Mother of the Book. We have intended to make the believers witnesses on earth, by God’s permission, the Most High. God is capable of all things. God has made the Reminder better for you than yourselves, for yourselves, to recite God’s signs to you, to purify you, and to bring you out of darkness into light. God is a witness over all things.</p>
<p>This is from the news of the unseen, which We reveal to him, so that people may be mentioned in the wonderful Reminder, with truth, in this gate, around the fire, witnessed. Glory be to the One who is without peer. God has given His servant what He has not given anyone from the gates, with truth upon truth. You have been given knowledge from the greatest Reminder, with truth upon truth, only a little from the letters around the water.</p>
<p>O people of the earth, do not follow the greatest Reminder in what the Ummiya did with Hussain, unjustly, in the sacred land. By God, the Truth, it is the truth, and God is a witness over it. The believers came to Us in the evening after the Book to weep for the greatest gate. Tell them to settle in the abyss of oneness. God is knowledgeable of what you do. Tell the believers not to follow Satan, for he has been a clear enemy to the believers in the Book of God.</p>

<p>Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sad. Praise be to God, who created the heavens and the earth in truth. Their judgment is decreed from the point of the letter B in the center of the fire around the gate.</p>
<p>We have sent down this book upon you in truth as a clarification, and we have made your sign by God’s permission in this book, determined by the judgment of the book, decreed in truth and with truth. Even if all people gathered, they could not produce a letter like it, even if some of them supported others. God, there is no god but He, the living, the worshipped, the ancient. He is knowledgeable of all things, and they encompass nothing of the knowledge of the book except what the Reminder wills. God is capable of all things.</p>
<p>God has created for you a path, this gate, extended, and has ordained for you a mountain, raised in truth and with truth. God has intended to bring you out of darkness into the book, witnessed in truth, so you may seek His bounty from what you were in, away from untruth, forsaken. Seek forgiveness from God, your Master, there is no god but He, the Truth. You will find God oft-returning, merciful at the gate.</p>
<p>He is the one who sent down from the sky upon you, in truth, water from the gate, abundantly. He brought forth for you from your land gardens of joy and colors by His power. He is capable of all things. So you may know that your Lord, the Most Merciful, is knowledgeable of all things. There is no hidden thing in the heavens and the earth except that We have made it in this book, around the gate, concealed. God will inform you on the Day of Resurrection from the tongue of the Reminder about what you used to do in your secrets and openly. He is encompassing of all things in truth and with truth.</p>
<p>God has made for us a book, preserved in truth and with truth. God erases what He wills and confirms what He wills, and He has made the Reminder in the Mother of the Book, around the fire, concealed. Those who act in the guardianship of the people of God, the Truth, will witness their deeds from the Reminder, mentioned. Those who earn sin in the path of the tyrant, God has not decreed for their deeds any weight on the Day of Resurrection. God has prepared for them at the bottom of the coffin a great fire. He will show them their deeds as regrets upon themselves, scattered dust on the earth, like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, but when he comes to it, he finds nothing. They will find their deeds in Hell, fire upon fire, iron. This is the recompense for what they used to deny our signs in truth with untruth.</p>
<p>O servants of God, know that the proof of God has been in the Mother of the Book in that gate, eloquently. God has not made the command of the Reminder but Our command, raised in truth and with truth. O people of knowledge, fear God in the Reminder, and God will teach you from the tongue of the Reminder the interpretation of the book, in truth and with truth, uniquely. God has sent down the signs in that book so that people may witness our signs in that gate.</p>
<p>We have sent down the command upon Our servant, in what has been in the Mother of the Book, in truth and with truth, altogether. He has been the servant of God, in truth, on the upright path with justice, around the fire, straight. O people, the command has come to you from the Most Merciful, in truth and with truth, around the fire, uniquely. God has not willed on this day, except His servant, the beloved, in truth and with truth.</p>
<p>Fear God from a day that has been new in the Mother of the Book. God has informed the believers of the judgment of the brothers of Joseph after returning from the land of oneness, what they did to Joseph in truth. God is knowledgeable of all things. When they returned in truth, they said, “O our father, we went racing on the land of blindness and left Joseph with the belongings of oneness from our Lord, who is without peer. The watchers devoured him with an indication in the abyss of innovation. They were mentioned in the Mother of the Book as the wolf.”</p>
<p>They said the letters “There is no god but God” upon the land of blindness. “You would not believe us in prostration even if we witnessed in truth and with truth, praiseworthy.” This judgment is the truth from God, our Master, as God decreed the prostration of the stars to Hussain upon the dust, judged by the gate around the fire. We have been truthful in our testimony to the secret of oneness from Hussain, in truth and with truth. God suffices as a witness over ourselves in truth and with truth. God knows what is in the heavens and the earth. He is the Most Merciful, upon the Throne, in truth, over all worlds equally.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-sinai-surah-19">The Surah of Sinai (Surah 19)</h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>
<p><em>They brought his shirt with false blood. He said, “No, your souls have enticed you to something. Patience is most fitting, and God is the one sought for help against what you describe.”</em></p>
<p>Alif Lam Mim Ra. Hear the call of your Lord on Mount Sinai: there is no god but He, and I am the Exalted. What God has decreed in the Mother of the Book has been concealed in truth. God has sent down the greatest truth in His word so that people may know that God has preserved fire in the point of ice.</p>
<p>We have made the Reminder from Us, raised in truth and with truth. We have made it powerful with God, and exalted in truth. Fear God, O servants of God. We have favored Our servant above many of those whom We have created, so that you may know that God does what He wills and rules as He pleases, witnessed in truth and with truth.</p>
<p>We bestowed favor upon you in your youth by the command of the Exalted God, when the decree in the Mother of the Book was ordained. We have sent down to you in your maturity this book, a book witnessed in truth and with truth. God has ensured your true matter with Us, and the promise in the Mother of the Book has been fulfilled. We have given you a book in truth and with truth, witnessed in secret. We are the speakers behind you, in truth and with truth, by God’s permission, the Exalted, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Convey to the servants Our command, which God has intended for you, in truth and with truth, praiseworthy. Know, O servants of the Most Merciful, if you are in this gate, in truth, fearing God, that God has favored you above the worlds with Our command. Follow what has been revealed to Our servant in this book of the world’s judgments, all in truth and with truth. God does not want from you today anything but His remembrance, firmly in truth.</p>
<p>Did not the Most Merciful promise you His signs at this gate as a reminder? Did We not say to you that We have a just measure in every successor, in truth and with truth? Why do you not believe in Our signs if you are sincerely with God, the Exalted, the Strong? God has willed in this book Our secret command, in truth and with truth, so that people may enter the houses of God through their doors, in truth and with truth, humbly and submissively.</p>
<p>God has intended from the men of the house, Our first followers, who were the keepers of the gate in truth, to establish them on the heights around the gate, in truth and with truth, recognizing each by their marks, by God’s permission, the Exalted, the Pure, as noble steeds. O evil servants, why do you not believe in this gate of God, the Exalted, the Strong, openly? Did We not create you and mention you in the Mother of the Book, around the gate, remembered? Did We not extend you and guide you in the powerful way of truth? Did We not provide you abundantly from the bounty of the Exalted God? God has made the command of Our servant in truth and with truth, near and singular.</p>
<p>So await the victory of God for yourselves. When Our command comes, it will come suddenly, greatly and mightily. This day is the truth from your Lord. On that day, you will possess nothing of the knowledge of the book, not even a letter, in truth, severed. The sovereignty that day is the truth for the Most Merciful. You will not be able to speak, nor whisper in truth. This is the straight path in the Mother of the Book, in truth and with truth. God has decreed this path around the fire, purely and straight.</p>
<p>They say, “When is it?” Say, “It is with God, perhaps God’s command is near.” When the brothers of Joseph came with God’s shirt to their father, with thin, reddish blood, witnessed around the fire, God informed them that Joseph’s blood was written as God’s fire in the Mother of the Book. God has made the unity of the gates in that greatest gate false blood, thin, as written in the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>We say, “No, your souls have enticed you with God’s command. Patience and reliance on God is most fitting for what God has decreed on the Day of Remembrance, witnessed.” God is the one sought for help concerning the matter of Joseph and the gate. God is capable of all things.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-light-surah-20">The Surah of Light (Surah 20)</h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.</p>
<p><em>And there came a caravan, and they sent their water-drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, “Good news! This is a boy!” And they concealed him as merchandise, but God is knowledgeable of what they do.</em></p>
<p>Alif Lam Mim. Listen to what is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley, at the point of fire in the heart of ice, around the truth. God has decreed what He has ordained, and the beginning has been witnessed at the point of conclusion. God, there is no god but He, and He is encompassing of all things.</p>
<p>We bestow sovereignty on whom We will among Our servants by God’s permission, the Truth, without cause. God’s word does not change in truth and with truth. God has made us powerful with the mighty name. When Our command comes in truth suddenly, the hearts will boil over in truth and with truth at that gate, in a great rush. On that day, the believers will rejoice at meeting Us, in truth and with truth, with joy and happiness.</p>
<p>The hands of the Jews and the Christians have become bound in what they say against Us, falsely and deceitfully. God has made Our hands extended, spending on whom We will among Our servants, in truth and with truth, from that gate abundantly. We withhold from whom We will among Our servants, justly and with praise. No one has the right to speak about Us falsely and deceitfully.</p>
<p>Know, O servants of God, that the light has come to you from the Exalted God, brightly, so that you may seek His bounty from what He has decreed in His dominion, in truth and with truth. Do not stray far from your journeys from what God has decreed in your journeys to that gate, in truth and with truth, closely. God is the All-Knowing, and you do not know anything of the knowledge of the book in that gate. We teach those who enter that gate, in truth and with truth, whom We will among Our servants, those who were written as pure in the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>We have decreed for the wrongdoers the fire of Hell, in the wondrous command of the Exalted God, decreed. O servants of the Most Merciful, God has made among you a reminder and a bearer of good news like yourselves. If you love God, follow him; God will love you. God’s promise is true in the Mother of the Book, fulfilled. We have sent down this book from God, blessed upon Our servant, so that you may believe in it and support him. On the day when God calls to you on the land of the heart, praised.</p>
<p>By God, the Truth, if you disbelieve after the Reminder has come to you with strong proof from your Lord, We will make you taste on the Day of Resurrection from the greatest torment in the depths of Hell, greatly. Know, O servants of God, that God has favored us over you with His own favor, and we have favored Our servant over you with Our favor upon you. If you are patient with His signs in truth, We have ordained for you in your book from before, the ordinances of the greatest name of God, in truth and with truth, greatly. Spend in the way of God from what God and His Messenger love, in secret and openly, so that you may be gathered on the Day of Resurrection among the lines of the believers.</p>
<p>Whoever turns away from Our Reminder, God will not accept any of his deeds. Satan has partnered with him in his command in truth, and he is rejected at that gate by God. We have placed protection in the hearts of those who believe in Our signs and glorify their Creator morning and evening from that exalted gate. God is Mighty and Praised. Fear God, O servants of the Most Merciful, and do much good.</p>
<p>O servants of the Most Merciful, take your adornment at every mosque. This is God’s command to you at that gate, in truth and with truth, as decreed in the Mother of the Book. We have sent the caravan of love by God’s permission to this love. The vision of the heart let down its bucket. He said, “Good news! This is the truth. This is a boy unlike any the eyes have seen.”</p>
<p>O people of blindness, conceal him as merchandise, altered from unity, so that you may be mentioned by the Exalted God around the fire. We have intended from this boy the greatest word. This is an Arab boy on the land of the heart, pure. God has preserved him in the depths of the well around the fire on the mountain of cold, in truth and for truth.</p>
<p>O believers, fear God and do not sell him for a counted price, away from the pure abyss of oneness. God is seeing of what you do. Know, O servants of God, in truth and with truth, that you should view him not with the eyes of your hearts. You have purchased him for a paltry price, counted dirhams. What God decrees for you in the book, the Reminder knows. You have not been brought forth by the secret of the heart. You come to Us with his shirt stained with false blood, and We say, “No, your souls have enticed you.” Patience is most fitting, and God is the one sought for help against what you describe falsely against Our servant.</p>
<p>If you recognize him by God’s sight within you, you have been guided like those before you. You bring me his shirt stained with false blood, a phantom, thin and red. But God has accepted this Reminder from you in favor, for you cannot do without it in truth and with truth. Keep God’s secret within you. God has made for you a station on the path, standing. Do not give wisdom to the foolish, for they have believed in the Exalted God and His secret and are in the abyss of weakness, weak.</p>
<p>O servants of the Most Merciful, fear God concerning Our trusts in you and guard them as you guard yourselves, beautifully in truth and with truth. If you cannot guard them, return them to the truth and cast them behind the crimson sea in the world of blindness. Conceal them in the axis of splendor on Mount Sinai, in truth. You will find all your deeds with God at this gate in a sealed book, hidden and preserved. God, the Truth, has created you by His command. Do you find today, besides the Exalted God, any helper?</p>
