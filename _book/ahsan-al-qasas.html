<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>Praise be to God Who has sent down the Book upon His servant with truth, that it may be a light for the worlds, blazing and bright. This is indeed the path of ’Ali, established in truth before your Lord, already ordained in the Mother of the Book, straight and true. And indeed, in the Mother of the Book, with Us, it is for ’Ali, and upon the greatest truth, it was with the Merciful, wisely ordained. And it is the truth from God, and upon the pure religion, it was inscribed in the Mother of the Book, around the Mount, recorded. Indeed, this is the truth, the path of God in the heavens and the earth. So whoever wishes may take a path to God in truth. Indeed, this is the firm religion, and sufficient is God, and those with Him, knowledgeable of the Book, as witness. Indeed, this is the truth, upon the greatest word from God, the Ancient, sent around the fire. This is indeed the secret in the heavens and the earth, and upon the wondrous matter by the hands of God, the High, it was truly written in the Mother of the Book. God has decreed to bring forth that Book in the interpretation of the Best of Stories, from Muhammad, son of Hasan, son of ’Ali, son of Muhammad, son of ’Ali, son of Musa, son of Ja’far, from Muhammad, son of ’Ali, son of Husayn, son of ’Ali, son of Abi Talib, upon His servant, to be God’s proof from the Reminder upon the worlds, compellingly. I bear witness to God as He bears witness to Himself, that He is the truth, there is no god but He, and the angels, guardians around the Reminder with justice, there is no god but He, and He is God, knowledgeable of everything. The pure religion is this Reminder, whole. So whoever desires Islam, let him submit his affair, for God will write him in the book of the righteous, submitted. And upon the pure religion, it was with truth, praiseworthy. And whoever disbelieves in Islam, God will not accept from him any of his deeds on the Day of Judgment, not even a little, on the truth, by the truth, nothing. And it is right upon God to burn him with the fire of God, the wondrous, by the decree of the Book, from the decree of the Gate, destined. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, watchful over the believers. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, a witness over the believers. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, knowledgeable of the believers. God, there is no god but He, and He is God, encompassing the worlds. And God will not accept from anyone any deed unless he comes to the Gate, prostrating through the Gate. The Ancient God, praiseworthy around the Gate. God has authorized you upon truth, so prostrate and draw near, for in a drop of water, the fire was, God the truth was, prostrated upon the earth in truth, witnessed. O assembly of kings and sons of kings, turn away from the kingdom of God, all of you, upon the truth, beautifully. O king of the Muslims, then support after the Book, our greatest Reminder, in truth, for God has decreed for you and those barefoot around you, in valuation, upon the path, standing in truth, questioned. O king, by the truth of God, if you oppose with the Reminder, God will judge you among kings with fire on the Day of Judgment, and today you will not find, apart from God, the High, on the truth, by the truth, any helper. O king, purify the sacred earth from the people who reject the Book before the day the Reminder comes suddenly by the permission of God, the High, upon the strong matter, severely. And God has written upon you to submit the Reminder and its command, and to make the lands subservient in truth by His permission, for you are in this world, upon the kingdom, merciful, and in the hereafter, among the people of the garden of pleasure around the holy, you were dwelling. O king, let not the kingdom deceive you, for every soul will taste death, it was by the truth, upon the truth, written from the judgment of God, and be content with the judgment of God, the truth, for the kingdom in the Mother of the Book, concerning the Reminder by the hands of God, was truly recorded. And support God with yourselves and your swords in the shadow of this greatest Reminder for this pure religion, strong in truth, upon the truth. O minister of the king, ease off from God, there is no god but He, the just truth, and remove yourself from the kingdom, for we shall inherit the earth and those upon it, by the permission of God, the Wise, and indeed, it was with truth upon you and upon the kingdom, witnessed. And we have guaranteed for yourselves, by the permission of God, to obey the Reminder with pure truth, that for you in valuation, in the garden of Eden, is a great kingdom upon the truth. And your kingdom is vain, and God has made the enjoyment of this world for the disbelievers, and with God.</p>
<p>Your sovereignty, Hasan of the lineage, has indeed been in truth upon truth from ancient times, and indeed, for us in the garden of eternity, is a lofty kingdom. We grant it to whomsoever we will of our servants, those who were in this cause with God and for His signs, supporters in truth. O assembly of kings, convey our signs to the Turks and the land of India swiftly in truth upon truth, and beyond its lands, from the east of the earth to its west, strongly in truth upon truth. O servants of the Merciful, indeed, God has not created you and has not provided for you except for a matter that was with God in the Mother of the Book, great in truth upon truth. And follow what God has revealed to us of the decrees of the Gate in that Book, submitting to God and His command, pleased upon the truth. And know that if you support God, He will support you on the Day of Judgment with the greatest reminder, on the path, a noble support. By God, if you do well, you do well for yourselves; and if you disbelieve in God and His intentions, we are, by God, beyond creation and sovereignty, rich in truth. O people of the earth, whoever obeys the remembrance of God and this Book, has indeed obeyed God and His allies in truth, and indeed, in the hereafter, he is among the people of the Garden of Pleasure with God, written. And indeed, we have set the mountains moving on the earth and the stars upon the throne, around the fire, in the water’s pole, from the presence of the reminder with God, the truth. And none of you will forsake another, and He is the Dominant over His servants, and He is God, knowledgeable of everything.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-scholars-surah-2">The Surah of Scholars (Surah 2)</h2>
<p><em>Surah of Joseph Verse 1: “Alif, Lām, Rā. These are the verses of the clear Book.”</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate,</p>
<p>Alif Lam Ra. These are the verses of the clear Book, Alif Lam Mim. That Book, from God, the Truth, concerning the Reminder, was revealed in truth around the fire. Indeed, we have made the verses in that Book clear, a reminder and good news for the servants of the Merciful, for those who are with God and His signs, faithful in truth, who do not compel their parents and deter them with truth from deviance at the edge of the Book’s knowledge as a mandate. Just, who was with truth harsh upon the kingdom, those who fear their Lord, for a day that was in truth harshly written in the Mother of the Book, we fear from the Merciful on a grim day, a name inscribed in the Mother of the Book, a day when no soul controls anything for another soul, and the command then is for God, the Most High, and God was over everything a Witness.</p>
<p>Indeed, we have made the verses an argument for Our word over you. Can you produce a chapter like it? Bring your proof if you are truthful with God, seeing. By God, if humans and jinn united to produce the like of a sura from this Book, they could not, even if they supported each other. O assembly of scholars, fear God in your opinions from this day, for the Reminder among you from Us has been a ruling and witnessing truth. And disregard what you take from other than the Book of God, the Truth, for you stand accountable upon the Straight Path in valuation. And God has made suspicion in all the tablets a clear sin. And perhaps God will pardon you for what you have earned for yourselves before this day, for He is Forgiving, Merciful to the repentant.</p>
<p>And God has forbidden you from ruling on anything other than the pure knowledge from this Book, without truth and exertion. And indeed, We have sent down to you this Book witnessed in truth, so you may learn from what God has decreed in our favor, far from falsehood. And you have in the valuation on the Straight Path a position accountable in truth, truly. God asks His servants about what they do in the religion of God without true judgment in that Book, concealed. Soon, God will show you the signs of the Reminder suddenly on Earth in truth, imminent.</p>
<p>O assembly from the People of the Book, fear God and do not be deceived by your knowledge, and follow the Book from the Reminder in truth, by God, the truth, no soul that follows it but follows all the scriptures sent down from the heavens from God, the Truth, and God is aware of what you do. And no soul that denies the Book but denies the Oneness of the Merciful and disbelieves in the prophets and the scriptures sent from the heavens in truth, and their abode was the fire by truth, and God decreed the judgment in the Mother of the Book, executed in truth. And if God willed, He could have guided all people, and God has made our signs clear to the worlds. And the Reminder is the truth from God in truth, and God was over everything Powerful.</p>
<p>And when people disbelieved in our signs, they were ungrateful to God, the Most High, and those who disbelieved will know their place in a valley of the confined, which God named in the Mother of the Book as Hell. And indeed, we by truth make you taste the heat of Hell and your replacement from the toxic fire, decreed in the Book. This is indeed the truth from God as a recompense for your stubbornness with our signs and the remembrance of God, the Most High. This is the recompense like what you were in misery with God and with our signs, and the command of your Lord, the Merciful, is truth, and the promise of God was indeed enacted in truth. Praise be to God who revealed the light from Himself upon our servant to be a straight path in the worlds in truth, and indeed, We reveal to you what God has revealed to us; you were indeed high in the Mother of the Book with God. And what is in the heavens and the earth is by truth, and God forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and He is God, Powerful over everything. Fear the day you will return to God, and there is no judgment but His; there every soul is recompensed for what it has earned, and indeed, We do not wrong a thing.</p>
<p>Those who believe in the Reminder sent down to him from his Lord and the believers, each believes in God and His signs and do not differentiate between any of His signs, and the Muslims say by truth, “Our Lord, we have heard the call of God’s Reminder and obeyed, so forgive us, for You are the truth, and to You is the return by truth, O believers ! We indeed do not burden you except with what you can bear, and the kingship was God’s alone, God wants to lighten your punishment and send His mercy upon you, and no soul has earned anything except we have written it by the judgment of the Book, preserved. Say, ’Our Lord, God, our truth, there is no deity but He, so forgive us with Your mercy and have mercy on us, for You are our Patron, and write for us the return to You in truth by truth, God, there is no deity but He, created the letter Alif strong on the command, God, there is no deity but He, has decreed the letter Lam for His judgment on the judgment of the Book, God, there is no deity but He, has made the letter Ra for the expansion of His command as He wills in the Mother of the Book around the fire, decreed in truth.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-faith-surah-3">The Surah of Faith (Surah 3)</h2>
<p><em>Surah of Joseph Verse 2: Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’ān that you might understand.</em></p>
<p>We sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an so that you may understand. Ta-Ha. God has indeed sent down the Qur’an to His servant so that he may teach people that God has power over all things. He who sent down the Criterion in Arabic, without any crookedness, upon His servant, purely and truly as a revelation to show you His signs and the interpretation of the narratives along the right and straight path. Indeed, this is the path of ’Ali in the heavens and on earth, uniquely true from God, the Most High. He is God, there is no deity but He, He has sent down to you this Book with the greatest Reminder, affirming the messengers and what God has revealed in the scriptures; there can be no alteration to the words of God, the Truth, and it is the truth in the Mother of the Book, inscribed around the fire.</p>
<p>This Book, if it had been from other than God, the Truth, they would have found in it much discrepancy. And glorified is God, our Lord, nothing is hidden from Him on the earth or in the heaven, and we have recorded everything in this Book by God’s permission, hidden and truly inscribed from God. And those who disbelieve in the exalted door of God, we have prepared for them a painful punishment by the true judgment of God, and He is God, mighty and wise. Indeed, we have sent down to Our servant this Book from God in truth, and made the verses therein precise and unambiguous, and none knows their interpretation except God and those of Our servants whom we choose, the devoted ones.</p>
<p>So ask the Reminder for its interpretation, for he has been, by God’s grace, knowledgeable of its verses by the decree of the Book. Our Lord, we praise You after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You, as You were capable and giving by truth. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the greatest Reminder of God, their wealth and their children will not avail them against God in the least, and they have no power apart from God; those are the companions of the fire, by the just decree of God, abiding therein forever and ever. God has indeed supported with His help whomever He wills among His servants, and we have indeed made the love of women, sons, and wealth appear desirable to you, all of which are barriers to death. And God has indeed made good provision for those who support the remembrance of God, the Most High, with their hands, their tongues, and their wealth, God the Self-Sufficient, and He is God, mighty and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>When the People of the Book argue with you about something, say, “I have no knowledge except what my Lord has taught me; indeed, I have submitted my face to God, the creator of the heavens and the earth.” And whoever is arrogant in worshiping Him by turning away from My remembrance, it is right for God to burn him with the greater fire, justly deserved by truth upon truth. And you desire nothing except what God wills for you; indeed, He has been knowledgeable and wise. And the polytheists among you say, “The fire will not touch us except for a few days”; when we gather them on the Day of Judgment around the fire, they will testify against themselves that the punishment of their Lord had been inscribed in the Mother of the Book from the Door of old. And sovereignty belongs to God; He grants sovereignty to whom He wills and withdraws it from whom He wills, and He is God, powerful over all things. And we indeed humiliate the disbelievers as they wish and honor the believers as they wish, and God has indeed placed the good in your hands by truth, and God has placed your hands in the Mother of the Book, raised right. And indeed, in the creation of the night and day and their intermingling, and the bringing forth of the living from the dead and the dead from the living, are signs for the greater remembrance of God. Thus, it has been inscribed in the preserved tablet with God, the Most High.</p>
<p>O servants of the Merciful, do not take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers who preceded you. And whoever meets God with disbelief in the Book and this Reminder, then from God he will have nothing, and the Truth Himself has warned you, and to God, the Truth, is the return of all worlds if you fear your Lord, the Merciful, about what your hands have earned from the work of Satan, then hasten to forgiveness from your Lord before the day you find your deeds present before you. And God knows what is in the heavens and on the earth by truth, and He is God, rich over all worlds. O servants of God, the Merciful Himself warns you not to say about God except the truth, and He knows what you conceal in yourselves and what you declare, and He has indeed been kind and merciful to His servants on the truth by truth. O people, if you believe in God alone, then follow me in the greater remembrance of your Lord so that God may forgive your sins, and God has indeed been forgiving and merciful to the believers. And we indeed choose the messengers by Our word and favor their descendants with the great remembrance of God, some over others by the decree of the Book, hidden. And we indeed have given you the judgment of the doors by the permission of God, the All-Hearing, and He is God, a witness over all things. And we indeed sent Our spirit to Mary and accepted the vow of the wife of Imran, dedicated by God, the Most High, and He is God, knowledgeable of His believing servants. And we indeed gave the prophet Zechariah the good news with Our name, John, affirming the word of God, the greatest; this is from God, and we make him by that a master and a keeper in the Mother of the Book. The creation of the worlds is like Our command; when we want to say to it, “Be,” it becomes, in the Book of the praised God, existing around the fire. And God has taught you the knowledge of the Book from the Criterion, the Gospel, the Torah, the Psalms, and what is beyond them from the scriptures, and you have indeed been at your Lord’s door at the point from the concealed ‘Ba,’ stopped. And we indeed have inspired you with news of the unseen and sent down to you this Book in truth, and we have forbidden you the impurities and made lawful for you the good things so that people may believe in your remembrance, hoping for the honor of God’s ancient religion by truth. And God was knowledgeable of all things. And those who think that they can harm you with something from knowledge have indeed fallen from the sky to a dead, uprooted earth, and God was a witness over all things. And God has made your being touched by our beings, and your existence a trinity of the light of God’s ancient essence, our Lord, and He is God, powerful over all things. And the polytheists plotted against themselves in your remembrance and will not harm except themselves, and God has indeed fulfilled His promise, and I am purifying you and causing you to die and raising you to God, the Truth, and you will judge by God’s permission on the Day of Judgment in what people differ in the remembrance of God, the Most High, and God was a witness over all things. Some from the city said, “We are the supporters of God”; when the Reminder came to them suddenly, then they turned away from our support, and God is my Lord and your Lord, the Truth, so worship Him, and this is the straight path by your Lord, so soon God will judge between people by truth, then they will not find in themselves any distress from God’s pure judgment, and the matter was decreed in the Mother of the Book. And when the matter reaches intensity, argue by God’s permission with the polytheists, and say, “Come, let us call upon our Lord, who is no deity but He, by ourselves and yourselves, and God is indeed the Truth, a witness over us, and He is God, knowledgeable of all things. By your Lord, if you confront the disbelievers, and God is indeed the Truth, a witness over us, and He is God, knowledgeable of all things. By your Lord, if you confront the disbelievers, people look to the edge of the sky, and we have sent down upon them by God’s permission a lightning bolt of firestone, and if not for your prayer, the earth and some upon it would have been burned, and God was powerful over all things. Say, O People of the Book, believe in a word from God, equal between me and you, that you worship none but Him, and do not associate anything in His worship, and do not take from among you some as lords apart from God; He is one God, like whom there is nothing, and He is God, a witness over all things.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-the-city-surah-4">The Surah of the City (Surah 4)</h2>
<p><em>The Surah of Joseph Verse 3: We relate to you, [O Muḥammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur’ān although you were, before it, among the unaware.</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>We relate to you the best of stories through what We have revealed to you of this Qur’an, though you were unaware of it before. Truly, We have clarified the stories for those who desire us at the door, loving and responding. And indeed, We have sent down the Book in truth upon truth so that people might be in accordance with the Name of the Remembrance written in the Book.</p>
<p>We have indeed sent down the Book to every nation in their language, and We have indeed sent down this Book in the language of the Remembrance truly and wonderfully. It is indeed the truth from God and in the Mother of the Book, decreed among the most eloquent of Arabs. It is the most eloquent among the most articulate, and it is the greatest talisman in truth, and it was in the Mother of the Book marked as a talisman.</p>
<p>We have indeed made you a sun over the worlds and a luminous moon, a chaste herald, and a strong pillar over the worlds, that perhaps the people would be guardians of God’s signs in truth upon truth. But the people were not pleased with the true signs of God, and the people were strangely against God and His decrees.</p>
<p>O servants of God, did not our servant show you the true promise concerning what God intended for you in the proper religion? And indeed, God has made the signs our signs, and concerning the matter of the Remembrance, the decree of the Book was written in the Mother of the Book. This is one of them for anyone who has a covenant from the Merciful around their neck, truly and rightly, and has entered into that gate by the permission of God, the Praiseworthy, pure and cleansed.</p>
<p>O people of the city, you are the polytheists against your Lord if you believed in Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and the seal of the prophets, and his book the Criterion, which falsehood cannot approach. Indeed, We have sent down to Our servant this book by His permission, just like it, if you do not believe in it, then your faith in Muhammad and the book before was indeed a lie witnessed by God. And if you disbelieve in it, then your disbelief in Muhammad and his book was certainly known to yourselves truly and certainly.</p>
<p>O people of the city and those around it from the Bedouins, what is wrong with you, how did you disbelieve in Muhammad openly and wrongly after his death? Did not God and His prophet take from you a covenant regarding the guardianship of His successor in many places on the earth truly and abundantly? If you believed in God, who there is no deity except He, then what is wrong with you, how do you judge for yourselves with other than what God revealed in His true book preserved?</p>
<p>By your Lord, if you do not believe in our remembrance and this book, then be certain that your abode is the fire wherein you will dwell forever, and you will have no helper from God the Most High on the day of judgment. Indeed, some souls among you have died in disbelief before, and you did not believe in Muhammad nor those around him after his ascension except you disbelieved in his successor. What is wrong with you, do you not contemplate the Qur’an as a true revelation? God indeed promises you Paradise and Satan invites you to your religion which leads you to Hell.</p>
<p>So whoever among you wishes may believe and whoever wishes may disbelieve, and indeed God is free of need from all the worlds. And indeed, the power is with God, the Almighty of old. O people of the city, fear God on a day when you will not be able to do anything for yourselves, and indeed the decree from us was written in truth upon truth. What is wrong with you, how did you disbelieve in God, your creator, who there is no deity except He, who created you and provided for you from His bounty, and indeed He has always been a witness over you.</p>
<p>Will you not then contemplate the Qur’an as a revelation? Will they not then contemplate the Criterion as an interpretation? Fear God from whom we take on the truth severely, if you were in what you were and do not return to the high remembrance of God truly and soon. Then God will show you in the reckoning a fire that has encompassed yourselves; there you will find no helper apart from God the Most High. Have you believed in something other than the true God, and God has always been a witness over all things.</p>
<p>Have you believed in something other than the true God? God has always been a witness over all things. Have you believed in two souls other than the true God, while God encompasses all things? O delight of the eye, strike upon the people of the city a decisive blow. God has decreed for one of them two elevated gardens around the door, each with trees. One garden is watered from two basins, and the other drinks from two cups. Both are by God’s permission, surrounded by fire and stopped at two waters. There are also two rivers in the land of the two Wests, with whales in one of the bays.</p>
<p>Then he asked his companion among the first two, “Which of you will take charge in the other two?” And in those two hours standing, a month on the disbelief with certainty for the souls themselves and the two souls thereafter, by the true God, then connect with the truth. Which of the two souls in the two parties was praiseworthy around the fire? Indeed, the truth was recognized in the Sacred Mosque, seeing the state in the greater truth. Have you disbelieved in the one who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then fashioned you into a man? O people of polytheism, why have you made your hardship with the door another door? The true God has indeed set your seat by the fire. The book rules, settled and released.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-joseph-surah-5">The Surah of Joseph (Surah 5)</h2>
<p><em>Surah of Joseph Verse 4: [Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father,&nbsp;“O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.”</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>When Joseph said to his father, “O my father, indeed I have seen eleven stars, the sun, and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.” Indeed, We showed him in the vision that exalted station. And indeed, We recount to you from the news of the unseen from the Book of God, the Preserver, witnessed. And indeed, with what We have found from our sincere followers, God has clothed it as our beauty, a shining shadow. And again, no, what God intended in the belly of the Book is nothing without us, truly beautiful. And the Merciful has specifically mentioned Joseph, the essence of the Messenger, in the fruit of the virgin Hussein, son of Ali, son of Abi Talib, witnessed. God showed him above the throne with the sensations of the heart, that the sun, the moon, and the stars were indeed prostrating to him, God the Truth, witnessed.</p>
<p>When Hussein said to his father one day, “Indeed, I have seen eleven stars, and the sun and the moon, I saw them encompassing me in truth, prostrating to the ancient God.” God, who there is no deity but He, speaks the most truthful speech in truth, wonderfully. Perhaps the people were patient with the signs of their Lord in truth. Praise be to God who has interpreted Hussein’s vision in truth on the land of the heart, around the truth, witnessed. And God has decreed his testimony by the testimony of monotheism by himself about himself in truth, accepted because God has witnessed him by Himself with the testimony of monotheism from himself on the truth, witnessed.</p>
<p>And indeed, the Wise has informed about the secret of his vision in what has been revealed in the Criterion to His beloved, hidden. Indeed, the Qur’an of dawn was witnessed. And indeed, the stars of the throne prostrated in the Book of God for the killing of Hussein in truth upon truth, and their number was in the Mother of the Book, eleven. He is God who has placed monotheism in the realities of things, from His rays, in truth, willingly and unwillingly. And He is the one who has created the letters by Himself in truth as an example. And He is the one who has determined the letters of identity for His narrative in the greatest truth, eleven. And He is the one who has made the Imams the word of monotheism in the written line. And He is the one who has decreed the prostration of the sun, the moon, and the stars in the Mother of the Book by the decree of the Book, written. God, who there is no deity but He, and indeed your patron the truth is the most truthful of speakers in narrative.</p>
<p>And God intended by the sun Fatimah, and by the moon Muhammad, and by the stars the Imams of truth in the Mother of the Book, known. They are the ones who weep for Joseph by the permission of God, the truth, prostrating and standing. And the people weep like the shade of shelter for Hussein by the permission of God, the truth, prostrating equally. And whoever prostrates other than the Merciful or associates anything with God in worship, it is rightful upon God to admit him into the fire, abiding therein forever. Indeed, this is the true recompense from your Lord for what you were stubborn against our Lord’s signs. God, who there is no deity but He, the truth, and God was the Lord of the worlds, worshipped in truth.</p>
<p>And indeed, the innovations of the signs, the hours, the souls, and the horizons are signs for the first of understanding among you, who were witnesses by the high remembrance of God. Fear God and do not say in the greatest remembrance of God anything other than God, for indeed, We have taken His covenant from every prophet and his nation by His remembrance, and We did not send the messengers except with that valuable covenant. And We do not rule by truth anything except after His covenant in that greatest gate. Thus, God will unveil the cover from your sights at the appointed time; there you will be intensely looking at the high remembrance of God.</p>
<p>And the polytheists said, “Indeed, we have wronged ourselves after what God Himself warned us in His Book, and you were that day stopped in the hub of the fire.” There, you cannot escape, and when you ask for water from the owner, he will surely make you taste the water in the best part of the fire, hotter upon hot, and water from the best of the bitter tree. When you drink a drop of it, your limbs will be severed from your bodies, and you will wish for death, but God has not decreed that for you as recompense for your association with God in this world. And indeed, God was encompassing over everything.</p>
<p>And those who fulfill the covenant of God and do not purchase anything from the signs with anything false, those are on guidance from the high remembrance of God, and those are truly the companions of the garden in the Book of God, and indeed, the decree was written in the Mother of the Book. Those who believe in God and His signs in truth sincerely, God will reward them on the Day of Resurrection with double the reward and a good return in truth elevated. Indeed, this is the true recompense from your Lord, a plentiful reward. And indeed, this is the paradise God has decreed as recompense for your deeds, for what you have done in the religion of God, praiseworthy in truth. Do you think that other than our remembrance this is the truth from God, and it was not from God on the truth, or do you say upon God the lie? How often do you disbelieve in the praiseworthy God openly?</p>

<section id="the-surah-of-testimony-surah-6" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-testimony-surah-6">The Surah of Testimony (Surah 6)</h2>
<p><em>From the Surah of Joseph Verse 5: He said, “O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan. Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>He said, “O my sons, do not recount your visions to your brothers, lest they plot against you. Indeed, Satan is a clear enemy to man.” Remember the mercy of your Lord, His servant Ali, and indeed, We have revealed the Book to Our servant so that people may bear witness to the remembrance of God the Most High in this matter. And God did not intend anything from the servants on this day except by His true judgment as a revelation. If you love God, then follow Him; God will love you, and indeed the reward for remembering God the Great has been inscribed in His book by the hands of truth.</p>
<p>Whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see its full reward on the Day of Judgment, truthfully and abundantly given. And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil shall taste the fire named by the ancient God as bitter by the permission of God. And Ali said, “O my sons, do not tell of what God has shown you of your affairs to your brothers, out of mercy and patience for themselves.” God the Most High is just, and He is God, mighty and praiseworthy. If you inform them of your affair in any part of what God has decreed for you, they will plot against you to kill themselves in the love of God, excluding your true self as a witness.</p>
<p>And God willed, as He pleased, that your face should be bloodied on the ground, truly and deeply stained. And God willed, as He pleased, to see your hair dyed with your blood and your self on the ground, slain unjustly by the truth. And your body on the ground, naked, and God willed, as He pleased, to see your daughters and your women in the hands of the disbelievers, unjustly captives. And God willed, as He pleased, to see the faces of your followers before you, reddened with the dye of themselves and their bodies on the ground, wounded and unjustly cast down.</p>
<p>So do not reveal anything of what God has decreed in your essence from the secret of the hidden testimony to yourself, even a little of the word. If you inform them of your secret affair in truth, even a little, there they will sacrifice themselves for the love of God, longing for God. And God was, with His servants, truly and truly compassionate. God, who there is no deity but He, speaks the most truthful speech, wonderfully. Perhaps people were with the signs of their Lord, the Merciful, on the right path, in the ways of the door, praisefully grateful.</p>
<p>And indeed, the brothers of Joseph knew from the secret of his affair a letter on the secret, profoundly secret, and thus the traditions of the prophets and the martyrs have proceeded to be killed in His cause, and God was over everything truly a witness. And the devil’s disbelief proceeded after killing Joseph, and that matter was with the Merciful and His chosen ones and in all the tablets, truly and truly cursed. And after his disbelief, he intended greatly on the Greatest Word unjustly, but God will soon remove his concern and cast him into the sea of darkness, where some layers are above others, plotting.</p>
<p>And those who wronged us will know that they do not precede us in the knowledge of the Book, not even a letter, and we were encompassing over all worlds with God the Most High, truly and truly. And God has counted you in the Mother of the Book among the five hidden ones, secretly secret. And God has taught you knowledge that those before you could not encompass. And indeed, we have taught you the knowledge of innovations from the Merciful, innovatively, and what God did not will was not by anything, and it was not in the knowledge of your Lord by anything.</p>
<p>And God has spoken truly and truly, “Did you not pledge to you, O servants of God, in our true covenant on the truth, a heavy covenant, do not say about God the truth except the greatest truth, affirming and peacefully?” And indeed, we have taken from you in the sight of God a firm covenant, out of love for our followers from the Wonderful, on the truth, and the command was from God the Most High, great. And God intended for you in this book a command on the greatest truth, imposed, and people were in negligence and discord in this greatest gate from our great command, unjustly, and He is God, High, Great.</p>
<p>God is independent of you, and He is God, encompassing everything. Has not the remembrance of God reached you, O servants of God, repeatedly from our great command? O people of the earth, fear God in that cultivated leaf from the single tree, for indeed, by the truth, it is a right as He is God and His allies on the right, truly, and God was over everything a witness. And God has decreed among the servants that you worship none but Him around the gate, and this is the pure religion on the path of equity, beneficently.</p>

<p><em>The Surah of Joseph Verse 6: And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives [i.e., events or dreams] and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise.”</em></p>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p>Thus, your Lord chooses you and teaches you the interpretation of narratives and completes His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is all-knowing, wise. God has revealed the Criterion to our mention, that it may be a bearer of good news to all the worlds along the equator and a warner. Indeed, We have completed Our favor upon the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth with the bounty of the remembrance truly and justly as a grace.</p>
<p>And God has placed the greatest of blessings on this day of yours, the remembrance of God the Most High, and God was a witness over everything. Thus, We have chosen you truly and taught you from the interpretation of the Book, what is not befitting anyone but you. You have been foremost in response to God the Most High, truly and rightfully mentioned. And God has chosen Hussein from His servants and made him truly and justly an Imam and a martyr. And he preceded his brothers in the knowledge of the Merciful, a convincing letter on the secret, what was in the hidden line of the secret of concealment.</p>
<p>And God has completed His favor on Hussein and his successors by making their favor like His own favor over all the worlds. He is the one who accepts from his visitor by visiting the truth for himself and has called the martyrs to His throne in truth, there is no deity but He, without likeness, truly. And God has not decreed for His secret on a letter of the letters interpretatively. He is the one who promised the visitors to meet Himself, and God’s promise was truly enacted.</p>
<p>He is the one who decreed the square in the paths of the visit in the visit truly and justly, and the matter was decreed in the Mother of the Book around the fire. He is the one who chose for Joseph a letter from the secret and for his parents before a letter from the line around the secret, concealed. He is the one who was and nothing was with Him, truly and rightfully mentioned. He is the existing one, who always was and will be in His rank, nothing exists truly and justly.</p>
<p>He is the one who has taught you from the interpretation of the narratives as you wished by what We wished, truly and justly from the truth, wonderfully. He is the one who has raised the geometry from that gate, honoring the gate, and God was over everything powerful. So follow what God has revealed to you in the matter of the remembrance openly with the greatest truth and in the greatest secret, for We do not wish for your souls but the gardens of Eden around the pleasure, existing truly.</p>
<p>We show you the truth; We do not want from you any reward for the greatest gate and on the truth, gratefully, except patience and helplessness. God the Most High, and He is God, mighty and praiseworthy. And the lands have been filled from the bounty of your Lord, the Merciful, generously. And We have extended to you as We began you, and we only confirm it in the Book of God, your denial of Our signs from the remembrance often. Why do you not remember for yourselves a reminder from God the truth a little?</p>
<p>How do you disbelieve in God, and you were dead not knowing anything from the knowledge of the Book, truly and justly? And He is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, then will revive you if He wills. Your possession and the greatest word from God, do you not fear from a day when a patron will not benefit a patron anything, and the kingdom on that day is truly for the Merciful, for the family of God, and for their followers, as was written in the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>On the day when the Spirit and the angels stand around the remembrance by the permission of God the truth, arrayed in a row, no one will enter Paradise except he who has a strong covenant from God on his neck. And those who disbelieved, who spoke the wrongful word unjustly, will not enter Paradise except those who were Jews or Christians. By God, those are their wishful thinking of polytheism, and the judgment was known in the Mother of the Book. Thus, they will face from the Merciful a command in truth, truly witnessed.</p>
<p>Those will not be able to and will not be able to benefit themselves apart from the remembrance, neither harm nor benefit, except by the permission of the Merciful who spoke truly in His Book from our servant, a letter on the truth, repentantly. Do people think that we were distant from the creation? No, on the day we unveil the leg above their legs, that people may see the Merciful and His remembrance in the land of gathering soon. They will say, “Would that we had taken a path with the door. Would that we had not taken any men besides the door unjustly, alas! The remembrance has come to us from before us and from behind us and from our left, and we were veiled from it.”</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>Indeed, in Joseph and his brothers, there were signs for those who ask.</em></p>
<p>Praise be to God who has exalted His signs in His noble book, and He is God, watchful over everything. Indeed, We have clarified the signs in that book for the people of understanding, those who have been solitary around the door. And God has exalted Joseph by our name, and God has made him a guardian in the book, stationed around the fire. And God has made Joseph and his brothers the word of monotheism and the Merciful has measured them with twelve letters. This word was in the Mother of the Book at your Lord, inscribed around the line, inscribed.</p>
<p>And God has specially attributed to Joseph the letter ‘Ha’ as a reward for his standing by the Merciful on the known day, truly and justly on earth, solitary. And God has made monotheism for those who inquire at our door and for those standing in the depths of uniqueness by our permission, those who have been upright around the door. God, who there is no deity but He, the truth, and He is God, worshiped in truth upon truth.</p>
<p>Fear, O servants of God, the day you were around the fire by the permission of God the Most High, questioned. Not a word do you utter but with it is an angel from us, by the remembrance, watchful. And our servant was never hidden on the day from the sincere servants of God. And God has created for you the Day of Resurrection as an appointed time of justice. The Day of Decision placed the balance by the permission of God before us, justly and upon the correct path, balanced.</p>
<p>Soon He will inform you on this day about what you have been doing in the religion of God, openly and secretly. O servants of God, have we not entrusted to you in our word, truly and clearly, a covenant not to say in our servant any of the letters deceitfully? So exalted is He who there is no deity but He, and He is God, encompassing the worlds. God did not intend from your creation but the prostration of the Merciful intended in this door’s path.</p>
<p>He is the one who created the believers from water that was in the Mother of the Book, fresh, and He is the one who made the realities of the disbelievers from salty water that was in the root of Hell, bitter. And God has made the realities of the believers, the signs of our servant, elevated for those who want God and His allies from before the door, sincerely chosen. And we have made our word on earth a witness by the believers. And we have raised him to the station of holiness, visible. And we have brought him close to us and made him firm in truth.</p>
<p>God has stationed him on the straight path in pure truth, commanded. And God has fixed him on the balance from the judgment of the Book, decreed by the Book, a lesson for those who are insightful at God the Most High, in truth. And a reminder for those who are around the fire by the wise fire, patient. And God intended by the name of Joseph our high word, which was witnessed around the fire. He is the one who sends upon you His signs by the permission of God, fearful in truth, truly monastic.</p>
<p>A reminder for whoever wishes to remember or fears the Merciful in the just judgment, which was truly decreed. And He is the one who has taught you in His signs the origins of the hereafter, perhaps people were content with God and His signs in truth. By the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is indeed the truth from us. And we have taken our covenant with the permission of God from all the worlds, for rarely do people say if God had sent to us a human in his absence, we would have followed him, and we would have been guided by his judgment to the truth, guiding.</p>
<p>Fear, O servants of God, the day the judgment of the book was decreed in the Mother of the Book. Did you not think in the remembrance of God the Greatest and our word a false thought? By your true Lord, you do not know a letter of His knowledge, what God has taught in the Mother of the Book, truly and justly from ancient times. So remember the remembrance of your Lord, the Merciful, at both ends of the day and in part of the night, as God has commanded you in His book before, and the judgment of God was decreed in the Mother of the Book.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>When they said to Joseph and his brother, “Our father loves you more than us, and we are a strong group. Truly, our father is in clear error.”</em></p>
<p>God has revealed the Book from Him, clarifying everything, a mercy and a good news for Our servants who have knowledge of the high remembrance of God, insightful of the Book. When they said the letters, “There is no god but God,” and that Joseph is more beloved to our father than us by what preceded of God’s knowledge, a letter hidden in the secret, veiled in the secret, absent in the line, elevated in the secret of the hidden, beyond what is in our hands and the hands of all worlds.</p>
<p>And indeed, We are a faction in what God intended concerning the matter of Joseph, the Prophet Muhammad the Arab, written around the line. And God has favored our father with His own grace and measured the hidden secret of His affair by what is in the hands of the worlds with clear revelation. The Merciful is established on the throne, and He is God, was over everything capable. And God has created things by His power truly and justly, and He is the one who invented the heavens and the earth and what is between them by His command, creatively around the fire, to teach people that the matter of God was in the Mother of the Book, existing around the fire truly and justly.</p>
<p>And He is God, was by His power watchful over everything, and He is God, was encompassing everything. And He is God, intended in the hidden of the secret on the secret of the line at the point of the door, interpretatively. And He is the one who made the selection from the door for the knowers truly and justly witnessed. O servants of the Merciful, shake towards this date palm trunk by the permission of your true Lord, God, who placed it in the Mother of the Book truly and justly from the truth, high. And He is the one who drops from it to your souls, moist on the truth truly, harvested.</p>
<p>For indeed, We have marked His remembrance by the Merciful in a day that was in the Mother of the Book anciently, and you in that day were not forgotten in the book, nor around the fire forgotten. And do not say how does one speak about God who was in the age on the truth truly, twenty-five. Listen, for by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, I am a servant of God, clear signs have come to me from the remainder of God, the Awaited Imam before you, this is my book, it was with God in the Mother of the Book, written truly on the truth.</p>
<p>And God has made me blessed wherever I was and commanded me with prayer and patience as long as I am alive among you on the earth. And those who invoke from God some of the narratives concerning the door on the door unjustly a little, do they think they can produce a book like this from God, the truth, witnessed on the truth? The truth truly says, “There is no god but God alone, He has no partner, and there is nothing like Him, and He is God, was by the truth on the truth anciently. If the humans and the jinn were to gather to produce a book like this truly, they would not be able, even if they were from the people of the earth and like them helped by some.</p>
<p>By your true Lord, they would not be able with a fraction of its letter, nor on its interpretations of some of the secret, at all. And God has sent it down by His power from Him, and people cannot match a letter of it by analogy at all, without comparison. These are the news of the unseen inspired to you, you were by God, the Praiseworthy, around the fire, and soon your Lord will come to you on the Day of Judgment, the judgment of truth raised from Him. Enter whom you wish into the mercy of God and turn away from the wrongdoers around Hell and let them in the fire on the truth, prostrate.</p>
<p>Do you believe in some of the book and disbelieve in some? Has God permitted this for you, or do you invent lies about God from where you were by the knowledge of Satan unjustly on the wrong by the truth, deceived? And indeed, We have sent down the remembrance, and God and His angels were over you by the truth, watchful. Fear, O servants of God, and be sincere in the religion of God, witnesses on the truth. Those who fear their Lord in the unseen and were by the Merciful and His allies around the door, chosen truly, so soon God will teach them their judgments of what they need for themselves openly from the truth to the truth soon.</p>
<p>And God has revealed to me if you love God, then follow me in this religion by the truth on the truth from the truth to the creation, uprightly. And your Lord, God, said by the truth, “I am merciful on my believing servants from the people of the door truly on the truth.” And exalted is God above what the wrongdoers say in the signs of the door, greatly high. Say, “The command of God has come, so do not hasten it, for the command of God was on the truth by the truth near, and the promise of God was truly enacted.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-blindness-surah-10">The Surah of Blindness (Surah 10)</h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>“Kill Joseph or cast him to the earth; it will free your father’s face for you, and you shall be a righteous people thereafter.”</em></p>
<p>Mention the Greatest Remembrance in the remembrance of our Lord the Most High, praiseworthy. So exalted is He who has revealed the Book as He wished, with what He wished, and He is God, was over everything capable. And I was not except as We willed, and God was a witness over everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, We have favored Joseph and his brothers with signs from the secret of that great door, making it clear. If they said, “Conceal the sign of Joseph which God has placed among you to be upon the truth on earth, able men,” or “Cast him to the land of uniqueness so your father’s face may be freed for you, and you may thereafter be a people on the kingdom, pure with the hidden secret.” He is the one who has revealed among you a soul from your souls, and indeed, We have made him a human on the truth, noble.</p>
<p>And indeed, We have made the heavens and the earth signs for Our servant, and God was a witness over everything. Soon God will show you in the seat of truth His signs on the truth, truly great from Us. And indeed, We have sent down the signs in the scriptures, and God was knowledgeable of His signs and the remembrance truly and justly. And indeed, We have shown you signs of God in the horizons and within yourselves so that you may testify that He is the truth, and God has made the way for those who are by their Lord at the door, questioned on the truth.</p>
<p>And God has revealed this book to His servant to be a witness over the worlds by Our permission, truly and justly. And indeed, We have accounted in that book all that God has sent down to the prophets and the truthful in all the tablets, truly and justly together. And We have left from Our judgment in you what you have left from the Book of God, a letter on the covered secret, hidden. And people have lied about what they preceded us in obedience to the Merciful, somewhat, and God was a witness over everything on the truth.</p>
<p>Soon our servant will appear to you in a blindness of light for those who await the remembrance of God truly, morning and evening. Those are the ones whom God has made insightful in His pure religion and straight on the straight path. And from the people are those who say, “We believe in God,” and mention the Greatest, and God was insightful over His servants on the truth. They have disbelieved with their tongues after their souls were assured, and God knew them in their souls that they are disbelievers in God the Most High, newly.</p>
<p>Soon the fire and its stones will encompass them in the valley of Hell by the permission of God the Most High, soon. This was for you a recompense from God for what you were hypocrites in the religion of God, the just, and God was a witness to what you do. O people, has not the news of those before you come to you, and I warned you of the punishment of the Merciful truly and severely? Did not God promise you a paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth prepared for Our servants who were believers in the high remembrance of God and were pious in truth on the truth?</p>
<p>For you in it is what your souls desire by Our permission, truly and justly, a fresh bounty. So exalted is He who there is no deity but He, the Lord, and there is nothing like Him, and God was worshiped in truth on the truth. For indeed, We have warned you by the permission of God of a remembrance that you were deprived of without right. O people, aspire to the remembrance of God the truth, asking about the door, and to God the truth on the truth, devotedly.</p>
<p>For by the Lord of the heavens, God has indeed decreed your provision in this sky, truly and justly, descended and divided. What is wrong with you that you do not come out of your desires after the truth has come to you from God the Most High, great? He is the one who has decreed the sun as a light and the moon as a luminary that you may seek from His bounty the expanse of the goods of life, praiseworthy on the truth truly. And God has decreed the abode of the Hereafter for those who want God and His servant on the paths of the upright line around the fire, defined.</p>
<p>Know, O servants of God, that your Lord, God the truth, has delivered His argument to you for what you were with God and His signs on the truth, watchful. And only the believers are those who want in themselves nothing less than the Merciful and His remembrance on the truth, beloved. And indeed, the great secret has come to you and your openly from God for the great matter, wonderfully. Soon God will teach you of His command what no one before Him could encompass on the truth truly, expertly.</p>
<p>He is the one who has sent down from the sky blessed water on the earth, purifying. And He is the one who has created from water humans, then made them kinship and patient on the truth truly.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-surah-of-the-line-surah-11">The Surah of The Line (Surah 11)</h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate</p>
<p><em>One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the depths of the well so that some travelers might pick him up if you are to do something.”</em></p>
<p>Praise be to God who created the heavens and the earth truly and justly, layer upon layer, to show people that their Lord, the Merciful, is indeed the truth and that He was over everything capable. And He is the one who created you from dust, then from a sperm drop, then from a clot, then a lump of flesh, then He brought you forth as another creation. So blessed is God, the best of creators, wise.</p>
<p>And He is the one who keeps you in the darkness of the womb and brings you out of your mothers’ bellies while you know little of the book, only a fraction. Return to your Creator and kill yourselves in the way of the true God, humbly; God the Most High, and He is God, was mighty, praiseworthy. And He is the one who has sent down these verses to you from Him truly, as good news for all believers. He is God, worshipped; there is no deity but God truly, and He is God, was knowledgeable about everything.</p>
<p>And He is the one who gives you glad tidings by the name of His servant truly and justly, and he was indeed in the Mother of the Book by God, high and wise. And He is the one for whom God did not make the secret of His name known before, truly and justly named. And He is God, gave him peace on the day of his birth, the day of his mission, and the day he is gathered on the earth of the heart among those around the fire, uniquely and justly. That is the secret of secrets from the Wonderous one who there is no deity but He, the Most High, and God was over everything capable.</p>
<p>And God has managed the matter in the door by His power, and the judgment in the Mother of the Book around the fire was decreed. And indeed, we have made you a great sign by the permission of the true God, and God was a witness over everything. And you are of the great prophets truly, you were witnessed around the fire. And indeed, we have prevented you from mentioning the door by the permission of your true Lord God, from what you were unrightly, improperly sighing. The day we fold the sky with our hands, the matter was decreed truly, and the oven fled by the permission of the true God, and God was over everything capable.</p>
<p>There, you will recognize from our command what you were far from unrightly. On that day, the believers will rejoice soon by the permission of God the Most High. Soon the believers from the people of the door will rejoice with what their Lord has brought them from the spirit, and the spirit in the Mother of the Book around the water was fragrant. And God has made for you this day on the land of the path on the bridge of fire, a meeting time. When one of Joseph’s brothers, and he is Hasan ibn Ali in the Mother of the Book, was great by the fire, by the ancient fire, he said, “Do not kill Joseph but throw him in the depths of the well of uniqueness around the fire, hidden.”</p>
<p>God intended from the well a blindness of the hidden in the air of the hidden secret on the secret in the Mother of the Book around the line, inscribed. People do not know what Joseph’s brothers have done, God in the right of Joseph the Most High was a witness. And God has decreed for Joseph a journey from the door to the door by the judgment of the Book around the fire, hidden. And God has made the visitors of Hussein a journey to the secure sanctuary by the permission of God the Most High, and He is God, was mighty, wise.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who travel from the door to God in the depth of uniqueness truly and justly around the door, solitary, those have found Hussein on the hidden edge truly, witnessed in the depths of the well. Those are the travelers in the Mother of the Book by the mention of the secret around the fire, inscribed truly and justly. And God has created Joseph and his brothers in the worlds of holiness from the drop of creation from that water, existing. When we found from Joseph a love towards the greater remembrance, we clothed him by the permission of God with the garments of prophecy by those who were his share in the Mother of the Book around the fire, decreed.</p>
<p>And we were not far from the truth about the worlds, and we recount to the servants the matter which people were deceitfully far from the truth about. God intended in your day today the greater word, this speaker about God truly at 25, wonderfully. While people did not believe in God and His signs truly, we preserved him in the depths of the well around the fire, hidden. And God has decreed that some travelers among you, who were in the Mother of the Book truly and justly in response at the door around the water, praiseworthy earlier, might pick him up. That was a judgment from God truly and justly, and the judgment in the Mother of the Book was decreed. And God has made you Muslims in His religion if you were with God and His signs truly and justly at that door, patiently.</p>
