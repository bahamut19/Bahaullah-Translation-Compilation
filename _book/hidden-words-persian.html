<p>In the name of the Powerful Speaker,</p>
<section id="verses-1-9" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-1-9">Verses 1-9</h3>
<p>1 O possessors of intellect and hearing!</p>
<p>The first message of the Beloved is this: O spiritual nightingale, do not perch except in the rose-garden of meanings. O hoopoe of Solomon’s love, do not take residence except in the Saba of the Beloved. O phoenix of eternity, do not accept any place except in the Qaf of fidelity. This is your place, if beyond all places, you take flight, then you fly with the soul and freely reveal the path to your station.</p>
<p>2 O son of spirit!</p>
<p>Every bird has its eyes set on the nest, and every nightingale’s aim is the beauty of the rose, except for the birds of the hearts of the servants who, satisfied with the transient soil, have stayed away from the eternal nest, and by paying attention to the flowers of the after, have been deprived of the flowers of nearness. What a wonder and regret, and alas and pity that they have passed by the bright ocean of the highest companionship and stayed far from the brilliant horizon!</p>
<p>3 O friend!</p>
<p>In the garden of the heart, do not sow anything but the flower of love, and from the nightingale of the heart, do not withhold the melody of longing and desire. Consider companionship with the virtuous a treasure, and from the company of the wicked, withdraw both hand and heart.</p>
<p>4 O son of justice!</p>
<p>Which lover would choose a home other than that of the Beloved, and which seeker would seek repose without the object of his quest? True lovers find life in union and death in separation. Their breasts are devoid of patience, their hearts sanctified from endurance. They would pass through a hundred thousand lives to reach the alley of the Beloved.</p>
<p>5 O son of dust!</p>
<p>Truly, I say the most heedless of all people is the one who disputes in words and seeks to surpass his brother. Say, O brethren, let your deeds, not your words, be your adorning.</p>
<p>6 O sons of earth!</p>
<p>Truly, know that a heart tainted with even a hint of envy will assuredly not enter into the sovereignty of My eternity, nor will it perceive the fragrances of sanctity from My holy dominion.</p>
<p>7 O son of love!</p>
<p>From you to the fluttering of refusal at the proximity, and the Lote-Tree of the height of love, is but a step away. Take the first step, and set your other foot on the world of existence. Enter the pavilion of eternity and then listen to what has descended from the Pen of glory.</p>

<p>8 O son of glory,</p>
<p>Be active on the path of holiness and step into the realms of human compassion. Polish the heart with the essence of a pure soul and manifest the melody of devotion through the rhythm of your being.</p>
<p>9 O shadow of destruction,</p>
<p>Transcend the levels of humiliation and delusion, and ascend to the heights of honor and certainty. Open the eye of truth, so that you may behold the beauty of the Divine, and exclaim, “Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators!”</p>
<section id="verses-10-18" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-10-18">Verses 10-18</h3>
<p>10 O son of desire,</p>
<p>Truly, listen: the mortal eye cannot perceive the beauty of the eternal, and the dead heart remains occupied only with withered flowers. For each companion seeks its own kind, and finds companionship with its own essence.</p>
<p>11 O son of dust,</p>
<p>Become blind so that you may see my beauty, become deaf so that you may hear the sweet melody of my voice. Become ignorant so that you may attain a portion of my knowledge, and become poor so that you may draw from the ocean of my eternal abundance.</p>
<p>To be blind means to turn away from observing anything other than my beauty. To be deaf means to listen only to my words and not those of others. To be ignorant means to seek knowledge only from me. By purifying your eyes, purifying your heart, and refining your hearing, enter the vast expanse of my sanctity.</p>
<p>12 O possessor of two eyes,</p>
<p>Close one eye and open the other. Close one eye, meaning turn away from the material world and its distractions. Open the other eye, meaning focus on the beauty of the divine Beloved.</p>
<p>13 O my sons,</p>
<p>I fear that you may be engrossed in the superficial melody and miss the divine grace. Return from the transient abode and turn your attention to the beauty of the flower, not being captivated by water and clay alone.</p>
<p>14 O friends,</p>
<p>Do not pass by the beauty of the transient world and do not attach your hearts to the earthly dustbin.</p>
<p>15 O son of the spirit,</p>
<p>When the spiritual nightingale is prohibited from expressing the secrets of meanings and when all are forbidden from the melody of the All-Merciful and the call of the Sublime.</p>
<p>16 O essence of negligence,</p>
<p>Alas, that a hundred thousand spiritual tongues exist within my speaking tongue, and a hundred thousand hidden meanings within my apparent tone. But there is no ear to hear, and no heart to comprehend a single word.</p>
<p>17 O companions,</p>
<p>The gates of the realm beyond have opened, and the abode of the Beloved has adorned itself with the breath of the lovers. Yet, most have been deprived of this spiritual city, except for a few. And even among those few, only a small number are truly witnessed, with a pure heart and a sanctified soul.</p>
<p>18 O inhabitants of Paradise, proceed!</p>
<p>Inform the people of certainty that in the sacred expanse, a new garden of proximity and divine pleasure has emerged. All the noble and eternal beings have gathered around that blessed abode. Therefore, make an effort to reach that station, seek the truths of the mysteries of love from its branches, and discover all the profound wisdom from its remaining fruits. The eyes of those who enter therein shall be delighted and secure.</p>

<section id="verses-19-27" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-19-27">Verses 19-27</h3>
<p>19 O my friends,</p>
<p>Have you forgotten that truthful and radiant morning when, in the shade of the Tree of Intimacy planted in the great Paradise, you were all present in that blessed realm before Me? I spoke words of purity and you heard all those words, becoming captivated by them. And those words were this: O friends, do not choose your own desires over My will. Never seek what I will not grant you. When you sanctify the forefront, consider the state of that plain and that expanse, and let my expression be known to all of you.</p>
<p>In the eighth line of the lines of holiness, which is mentioned in the fifth tablet of paradise:</p>
<p>20 O sleepers in the bed of negligence,</p>
<p>Centuries have passed, and you have brought your precious lives to an end, yet the pure breath has not reached you from our exalted realm of sanctity. You are immersed in the depths of polytheism, while uttering the word of unity. You have considered me, the Beloved, as your enemy, and have taken your enemy as your friend. You walk upon My earth in complete joy and delight, unaware that My earth detests you and the things of the earth turn away from you.</p>
<p>If you were to open your eyes completely, you would find a hundred thousand sorrows more delightful than this joy, and you would consider annihilation better than this life.</p>
<p>21 O moving dust,</p>
<p>I am close to you while you are doubtful of Me. The sword of disobedience has cut off the tree of hope for you. In every state, I am near to you, but you remain distant from Me. I have granted you immeasurable dignity, but you have chosen endless humiliation for yourself. Finally, return and do not miss the remaining opportunity and time.</p>
<p>22 O son of desire,</p>
<p>People of knowledge and insight have strived for years, yet they have not attained union with the Possessor of Majesty. They have run their entire lives, but have not reached the meeting with the Possessor of Beauty. And here you are, having arrived at the destination without seeking, and having attained the goal without desiring it. Yet, despite all these ranks and stations, you have veiled your soul to such an extent that your eyes did not fall upon the beauty of the Beloved, and your hands did not reach the embrace of the Friend. So, wonder at this, O possessors of insight!</p>
<p>23 O inhabitants of the abode of love,</p>
<p>The transient breeze has surrounded the eternal candle, and the beauty of the enslaved souls remains hidden in the dark clouds of oppression. The sovereign of all sovereigns of love is in the hands of unjust oppressors, and the sacred bath is held captive by owls. All the dwellers of the exalted realm and the high assembly lament and mourn, while you reside in complete ease in the land of oblivion. You have considered yourselves among the sincere friends, but in truth, your perception is in vain.</p>
<p>24 O known ignorants in knowledge,</p>
<p>Why do you proclaim youthfulness on the surface while being wolves among sheep within? You are like the star before dawn, which appears bright and shining on the surface but becomes the cause of misguidance and destruction for the caravans of the city and my abode.</p>
<p>25 O adorned on the surface but lacking within,</p>
<p>You are like bitter water that appears clear, showing only a glimpse of its sweetness and purity on the surface. But when it reaches the taste buds of the discerning, not a drop of it is accepted. Indeed, the manifestation of the sun can be seen in both soil and mirror, but there is a vast difference between understanding the difference and truly grasping the boundless distinction that lies between them.</p>
<p>26 O friend of my tongue,</p>
<p>Reflect upon this: have you ever heard that a beloved and a stranger can reside in the same heart? So, rid yourself of the stranger, that the Beloved may enter His abode within you.</p>
<p>27 O son of dust,</p>
<p>I have ordained everything that is in the heavens and the earth for you, except for the hearts, for I have designated them as the place of the manifestation of My beauty and grandeur. Yet you have given that place to others besides Me. Whenever the manifestation of My holiness appeared, you turned to strangers and rushed toward the boundless ocean of the Beloved. Despite this, I covered and concealed your shortcomings, and I did not expose your embarrassment.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-28-36">Verses 28-36</h3>
<p>28 O essence of desire,</p>
<p>Many mornings I came to you from the eastern horizon of non-existence, and I found you occupied in a comfortable bed other than Me. Like a spiritual lightning, I returned to the clouds of My sublime sovereignty, and I did not make My presence known among the troops of the sacred.</p>
<p>29 O son of generosity,</p>
<p>In the deserts of non-being, I manifested My command through the aid of the earth, and I entrusted to your upbringing all the possible particles and existential truths of the universe. Just as before your emergence from the womb, I ordained for you the two springs of radiant milk, and I preserved your eyes for protection. I instilled love for you in the hearts, and I nourished you with the pure bounty of My mercy. I preserved you through the essence of grace and mercy, and the purpose of all these stations was for you to bravely return to Me and become worthy of My hidden forgiveness. Yet, in your heedlessness, you became oblivious to the abundant blessings bestowed upon you. You mistakenly engaged in futile thoughts, eventually forgetting altogether. You turned your friend’s door into an abode for enemies and made it your dwelling place.</p>
<p>30 O servant of the world,</p>
<p>In the early mornings, the breeze of My favor passed over you, finding you asleep in the bed of oblivion. It wept over your state and returned.</p>
<p>31 O son of the earth,</p>
<p>If you desire Me, desire none but Me. And if you seek the manifestation of My beauty, turn your gaze away from the worldly distractions. For My will and the will of others cannot reside in one heart, just as water and fire cannot coexist in one vessel.</p>
<p>32 O stranger in this realm,</p>
<p>The candle of your heart is ignited by the hand of My power. Do not let it be extinguished by contrary winds of ego and desire. The remedy for all your ailments is the remembrance of Me. Do not forget it. Make love for Me your capital, and hold it dear like precious sight and precious life.</p>
<p>33 O my brother,</p>
<p>Listen to the sweet words from the tongue of gratitude, and taste the salty lips of My spiritual fountain. Come and drink from the cup of divine wisdom, and scatter the seeds of My teachings in the pure soil of your heart. Water them with the water of certainty, so that the blossoms of My knowledge and wisdom may flourish, sprouting from the fertile land of a pure heart.</p>
<p>34 O people of My paradise,</p>
<p>I have planted the sapling of love and friendship in the sacred garden of My eternal paradise, and I have nourished it with the waters of mercy. Now that it is close to bearing fruit, make an effort to protect it so that it remains preserved and unaffected by the fires of worldly desires and lusts.</p>
<p>35 O My friends,</p>
<p>Extinguish the lamp of misguidance and ignite the torches of guidance in your hearts, for soon the money-changers of existence will not accept anything but pure piety in the presence of the Divine Beloved, and they will not accept anything except righteous deeds.</p>
<p>36 O Son of Dust,</p>
<p>The wise among the worshippers are those who do not open their lips until they hear, just as the cupbearer does not pour the wine until he is asked. And the lover does not cry out from his soul until he attains the beauty of the Beloved. Therefore, you must preserve the seeds of wisdom and knowledge in the pure land of the heart and keep them concealed, so that the fruits of divine wisdom may emerge from within, not from the surface.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-37-45">Verses 37-45</h3>
<p>In the first line, the mentioned tablet is inscribed and preserved, and in the pavilion of God’s protection, it remains concealed:</p>
<p>37 O My servant,</p>
<p>Do not let the transient kingdom distract you from the eternal realm, and do not surrender the sovereignty of Paradise to base desires. The Kuṯṯah (the celestial river in Paradise) is the spring that flows from the fountain of the Pen of the All-Merciful. Blessed are those who partake from it.</p>
<p>38 O son of the spirit,</p>
<p>Break the cage and fly like a flock of love in the holy air. Transcend the self and find tranquility in the realm of divine grace with the breath of the Merciful.</p>
<p>39 O son of ashes,</p>
<p>Do not be content with fleeting comfort, and do not pass by the eternal garden of everlasting bliss for transient and earthly pleasures. Transform the garden of remaining joy into the fading flowers of mortal dust. Ascend from the prison to the delightful plains of the soul, and spread your wings beyond the confines of possibility.</p>
<p>40 O My servant,</p>
<p>Free yourself from the bondage of worldly attachments, and liberate yourself from the imprisonment of desires. Count your time as a precious bounty, for you will not see this moment again, and you will never retrieve this lost time.</p>
<p>41 O My servant, my humble servant,</p>
<p>If you perceive the remaining sovereignty, surely you will transcend the realm of fleeting possessions with utmost determination. However, its covering lies in wisdom, and the manifestation of this lies in secrets that only the purest hearts can perceive.</p>
<p>42 O My servant,</p>
<p>Purify your heart from impurities and let it glide on the plane of divine unity without envy.</p>
<p>43 O My friends,</p>
<p>Walk on the path of the Beloved’s pleasure and know that His pleasure lies in His creation. That means a friend should not enter the house of the Beloved without His consent, nor should they interfere with His possessions. They should not prioritize their own desires over His pleasure and should not consider themselves superior in any matter. So reflect upon this, O people of understanding.</p>

<p>44 O celestial friend,</p>
<p>Don’t listen to the bad and don’t see the bad, and do not demean yourself, and bring about repentance, meaning do not speak ill so you won’t hear [it], and do not consider people’s faults to be great so your own faults won’t appear to be large. Do not accept self-humiliation so your disgrace will not reveal itself. Therefore, with a pure heart, a clean conscience, a sacred breast, and a distinguished mind, be free in the days of your life which are less than what you think, so when you are freed from this mortal body, you may return to the paradise of meanings and find a permanent place in the eternal dominion.</p>
<p>45 Alas, alas, O lovers of worldly desires,</p>
<p>You have passed by the spiritual beloved like lightning and have firmly bound your heart to a devilish illusion. You bow down to the illusion, and you’ve called it truth, and you gaze at the thorn, and you’ve named it a rose. Neither a breath of relief has risen from you, nor a breeze of detachment from the gardens of your hearts. You’ve given the compassionate advice of the beloved to the wind, and erased it from the page of your heart. You graze like beasts in the meadow of lust and hope for survival.</p>

<p>46 O brothers on the path,</p>
<p>Why have you become oblivious of the remembrance of the beloved and remained far from the proximity of the friend’s presence? The peerless beauty is evident in the unique tent, established on the throne of glory, and you have become engrossed in disputes over your own desires. The fragrance of sanctity is wafting, and the breeze of generosity is blowing, but you all have fallen prey to the cold and have been deprived of everything. What a pity upon you and those who follow in your footsteps and tread on the path that you have passed!</p>
<p>47 O sons of hopes,</p>
<p>Take off the robe of vanity from your body and cast off the garment of arrogance from your flesh.</p>
<p>In line thirty from the lines of sanctity, which is recorded by the hidden pen on the ruby tablet, it is:</p>
<p>48 O Brothers,</p>
<p>Show consideration to each other and detach your hearts from the world. Show honor with dignity and refrain from disgraceful humility. I swear by my beauty, I have created everything from dust, and indeed, I will return it to the dust.</p>
<p>49 O sons of the soil,</p>
<p>Inform the rich about the dawn cry of the poor so they don’t perish due to negligence and remain without a share from the lote-tree of fortune. Generosity and benevolence are my characteristics; blessed are those who adorn themselves with my traits.</p>
<p>50 O naive lover,</p>
<p>You should abandon greed and be content with contentment, because the greedy have always been deprived, and the content ones are beloved and acceptable.</p>
<p>51 O son of my maid,</p>
<p>One should not worry in poverty and should not be assured in wealth. Every poverty has wealth following it, and every wealth has destruction trailing behind. However, the poverty bestowed by us towards Allah is a great blessing, do not consider it insignificant, because at its peak, the wealth in Allah will be revealed. At this stage, you are the concealed poor, and the blessed word “and Allah is the Rich (self-sufficient)” will appear, shine, become evident and clear like the true dawn from the horizon of the lover’s heart, and will be established and find its place on the throne of wealth.</p>
<p>52 O sons of heedlessness and desire,</p>
<p>You have allowed my enemy into my house and driven my friend away from me, insofar as you have allowed the love of others than me to reside in your heart. Listen to the words of the friend and turn towards his approval. Friends in the apparent world love each other for their own benefit, but your spiritual friend loves you for your sake, in fact, he has accepted countless trials specifically for your guidance. Do not act unjustly towards such a friend, and rush to his lane. This is the sun of the word of truth and loyalty, which has radiated from the horizon of the index finger of the master of names. Open your ears to the hearing of the word of God, the overseer, the eternal.</p>
<p>53 O ones deluded by transitory wealth,</p>
<p>Know that wealth is a firm barrier between the seeker and the sought, and between the lover and the beloved. A wealthy person never enters the abode of proximity, nor does he reach the city of contentment and surrender, except a little. Therefore, it is good for that wealthy one whose wealth does not prevent him from the eternal kingdom and does not deprive him of eternal fortune. I swear by the greatest name, the light of that wealthy one illuminates the people of heaven just as the sun illuminates the people of earth.</p>
<p>54 O wealthy ones of the earth,</p>
<p>The poor are my trust among you, so take good care of my trust and do not fully expend it for the comfort of your own souls.</p>

<p>55 O child of desire,</p>
<p>Purify yourself from the defilement of wealth and step into the heavens of poverty with perfect tranquility so that you may drink the wine of eternity from the eye of transience.</p>
<p>56 O my son,</p>
<p>The company of wicked ones increases sorrow, and the companionship of the righteous removes the rust from the heart. Whoever wishes to find companionship with Allah should find companionship with His beloved ones, and whoever wishes to hear the words of Allah should listen to the words of His chosen ones.</p>
<p>57 Beware, O son of dust,</p>
<p>Do not associate with and seek companionship with the wicked, as the company of the wicked transforms the light of the soul into a flame of torment.</p>
<p>58 O son of my handmaid,</p>
<p>If you seek the grace of the Holy Spirit, associate with the free, for the righteous have drunk the eternal cup from the hand of the immortal cupbearer, and they revive and illuminate the hearts of the dead like the truthful dawn.</p>
<p>59 O heedless ones,</p>
<p>Do not presume that the secrets of hearts are hidden. Rather, be certain that they are inscribed with a manifest script and are visible in the presence of the divine court.</p>
<p>60 O friends,</p>
<p>Truly I tell you that all that you have hidden in your hearts is as clear and manifest to us as the light of day. However, its concealment is due to our generosity and grace, not your deserving.</p>
<p>61 O son of man,</p>
<p>I have bestowed a dewdrop from the deep ocean of my mercy upon all creation, but I found no one receptive. Indeed, all have turned their faces from the delicate wine of eternal unity to the foul water, and they are satisfied with the mortal cup instead of the cup of everlasting beauty. How terrible is what they are content with.</p>
<p>62 O son of soil,</p>
<p>Do not close your eyes to the matchless wine of the Eternal Beloved, and do not open your eyes to the turbid wine of transience. Take the everlasting cups from the hand of the Unique Saki (cupbearer), so that you may come to your senses and hear the spiritual mysteries from the invisible realm. Say, O lowly ones, why have you turned from my holy everlasting wine to the transient water?</p>
<p>63 Say, O people of the earth,</p>
<p>Truly know that a sudden calamity is pursuing you and a mighty retribution is behind you. Do not imagine that what you have committed has been obliterated from view. I swear by My beauty, that all your actions are recorded with a radiant pen on emerald tablets.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-64-72">Verses 64-72</h3>
<p>64 O oppressors of the earth,</p>
<p>Refrain from your injustice, for I have vowed not to overlook the oppression of anyone. This is a covenant that I have inscribed in the Preserved Tablet and sealed with the seal of My power.</p>
<p>65 O transgressors,</p>
<p>My forbearance has emboldened you and My patience has led you into negligence, so that you ride recklessly on the dangerous paths of the fire of your own desires. It is as if you consider Me to be oblivious, or to be unaware.</p>
<p>66 O wanderers,</p>
<p>The tongue is for mentioning Me, yet you use it for backbiting. If a fiery temper overtakes you, busy yourself with considering your own faults, not with backbiting My creatures, for each of you knows your own self better than you know the selves of My servants.</p>
<p>67 O children of fancy,</p>
<p>Know ye that while the radiant dawn of divine illumination sheds its lustre from the heavenly horizon of the Eternal, the satanic secrets and deeds committed in the gloom of night shall be laid bare and manifest before the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>68 O plant of the soil,</p>
<p>How is it that with soiled hands you touch the robe of your own life, and with a heart tainted by carnal passions and vain desires, you seek to commune with Me and strive to enter My sacred realms? Far, far away are you from what you wish!</p>
<p>69 O Sons of Adam,</p>
<p>Words of purity and deeds of holiness ascend to the heaven of divine glory. Strive that your actions may be cleansed from the dust of self and desire, and find acceptance in the court of His might. Verily, soon the assayers of existence in the divine presence will accept naught but purest virtue, and will receive no deed except that which is sanctified. This is the Sun of Wisdom and meanings, shining from the horizon of the mouth of divine Will. Blessed are those who turn towards it!</p>
<p>70 O Son of Worldliness,</p>
<p>The dominion of existence is indeed a goodly place if thou dost enter it, and the carpet of eternity a fine spread if thou dost step beyond the realm of the ephemeral. The intoxication of ecstasy is delightful if thou dost drink the wine of meanings from the hand of the divine cupbearer. If thou dost attain to these stations, thou shalt be freed from nothingness and extinction, from hardship and error.</p>
<p>71 O My friends!</p>
<p>Recall the covenant you have made with Me on Mount Paran, in that blessed place in time. I called to witness the Exalted Assembly and the inhabitants of the City of eternity for that covenant, and now, I see none abiding by it. Indeed, vanity and disobedience have erased it from hearts, leaving no trace of it. By My life, I have been patient and concealed it.</p>
<p>72 O My servant!</p>
<p>You are like a precious sword concealed in a dark sheath. For this reason, your value remains hidden from the jewelers. So, come out from the sheath of self and desire, so that your worth may become apparent and clear to the world.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-73-82">Verses 73-82</h3>
<p>73 O My friend!</p>
<p>You are the sun of the heaven of My holiness. Do not let the eclipse of the world lean towards you. Tear the veil of oblivion so that you may appear from behind the clouds without veil or covering, and you may clothe all creatures with the robe of existence.</p>
<p>74 O children of vanity!</p>
<p>You have passed away from My eternal sovereignty due to the transitory reign of a few days, and you adorn yourselves with yellow and red ornaments, and thus you take pride. I swear by My beauty that I will bring everyone into the one-colored tent of dust and remove all these different colors, except for those who come in My color, and that is sanctified above all colors.</p>
<p>75 O children of heedlessness!</p>
<p>Do not attach your hearts to a transitory sovereignty and become joyous. Your similitude is like an unaware bird that sings with utmost tranquility on a branch of a garden, and suddenly the hunter of death brings it down to the dust. Thereafter, nothing of its melody, body, and color remains. Thus, take a lesson, O servants of desire.</p>
<p>76 O son of my handmaid!</p>
<p>Guidance has ever been given by words and now it is given by deeds. That is, every noble deed must be made manifest from the temple of man. For all share in words, but pure and holy deeds belong particularly to our friends. Strive then with heart and soul to distinguish yourselves by your deeds. In this wise, we counsel you in this holy and resplendent tablet.</p>
<p>77 O son of justice!</p>
<p>In the night of His beauty, the immortal figure of fidelity turned back from the emerald heights of fidelity to the Lote-Tree Beyond Which There Is No Passing, and wept a weeping such that all the Concourse on High and the Cherubim wept at his lament. And after asking about the cause of his lamentation and crying, it was learned that he had stayed in expectation upon the heights of fidelity, but had found no scent of fidelity from the inhabitants of the earth, and so he had returned. It was observed that several Holy Shrines had been afflicted by the hand of the earth’s people. At that time, a heavenly maiden ran out unveiled and without any covering from the spiritual palace and asked about their names. All were mentioned, except one of the names. And when she insisted, the first letter of the name flowed from the tongue, causing the dwellers of the chambers to rush out of their lofty places. And when it came to the second letter, they all fell upon the dust. At that point, a call came from a place near, “No more is permissible. We indeed were witnesses to what they did, and to what they are doing now.”</p>
<p>78 O son of my handmaid!</p>
<p>Drink from the stream of meanings from the Tongue of the Merciful and observe the radiance of the lights of the Sun of Explanation from the Dawn of Glory, without any veil or concealment. Sow the seeds of my divine wisdom in the pure soil of your heart and water it with the water of certainty so that the green ears of knowledge and wisdom from my bounty may sprout from this good land.</p>
<p>79 O son of passion!</p>
<p>How long will you fly in the air of selfish desires? I have granted you the wings of grace to fly in the air of sanctity of meanings, not in the space of satanic illusion. I have bestowed upon you the shoulder of mercy so that you may seek refuge in the locks of my musk-scented hair, not to wound my throat.</p>
<p>80 O my servants!</p>
<p>You are the trees of My paradise, and you must appear with exquisite and abundant fruits so that both you and others may benefit from you. Therefore, it is necessary for all to engage in crafts and professions. These are the means of wealth, O you people of understanding! Indeed, all affairs are dependent on their means, and the grace of God will enrich you therewith. Trees without fruits are fit for the fire, and so it will always be.</p>
<p>81 O my servant!</p>
<p>The lowliest of people are those souls that appear fruitless on earth and are, in truth, counted among the dead. Indeed, the physically dead are deemed superior to these idle and neglected souls in the sight of God.</p>
<p>82 O my servant!</p>
<p>The best of people are those who earn through lawful means and spend for themselves and their relatives for the love of God, the Lord of all worlds.</p>
<p>The bride of extraordinary meanings, which was concealed and hidden behind the veils of speech, has, through Divine Providence and Lordly Grace, emerged and become manifest like a radiant beam of the Beloved’s beauty. I bear witness, O friends, that the greatest bounty, the perfect proof, the manifest evidence, and the firm argument have been given. Now let’s see how your efforts manifest from the stages of detachment. Thus, the bounty is completed upon you and upon all who are in the heavens and the earth, and praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
