<section id="recognize-his-revelation-and-follow-his-command" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recognize-his-revelation-and-follow-his-command">Recognize His Revelation and Follow His Command</h2>
<p>1 Indeed, the first thing that God wrote for the servants is the recognition of His luminous revelation and the rise of His command, which was the status of His soul in the world of command and creation. Whoever wins it has won all the good. And the one who is prevented, indeed, he is among the people of misguidance, even if he comes with all the deeds. If you have won this highest status and the highest horizon, it is appropriate for every soul to follow what was ordered from the intended one, for both together do not accept one without the other. This is what was ruled by the rise of inspiration.</p>
<p>2 Indeed, those who were given insights by God, they see God’s limits, the greatest reason for the order of the world and the preservation of nations. And the one who was negligent, indeed, he is among the savages. We have commanded you to break the boundaries of self and desire, not what was numbered by the highest pen. It is the spirit of life for whoever is possible. The oceans of wisdom and expression have roared with what the breath of mercy has stirred. Seize it, O people of understanding. Those who have broken God’s covenant in his commands and turned back on their heels, those are among the people of misguidance in the presence of the rich, the exalted.</p>
<p>3 O people of the Earth, know that my orders are the lamp of my care among my servants and the keys of my mercy for my creatures. Thus, the order was revealed from the sky of the will of your Lord, the owner of religions. If someone finds the sweetness of the explanation that appeared from the mouth of the will of the merciful, he would spend what he has, even if it were all the treasures of the Earth, to establish an order from his shining orders from the horizon of care and kindness.</p>
<p>4 Say, whoever passes by my boundaries recognizes my shirt and with it the banners of victory are raised over the canons and submission. My power’s tongue has spoken in the greatness of my majesty, addressing my creatures, that they should love my boundaries for my beauty. Blessed is the lover who recognized the beloved from this word that exudes the breezes of grace, which cannot be described by remembrances. By my life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of kindness, he orbits around my radiant orders from the horizon of creativity.</p>
<p>5 Do not think that we have revealed to you only the judgments. Rather, we have opened the seal of the sealed nectar with the fingers of power and capability. This is attested by what was revealed from the pen of revelation. Reflect on this, O people of thoughts.</p>

<p>6 Prayer has been prescribed for you, nine prostrations for Allah, the revealer of the verses, at noon, and in the early morning and evening. And we have forgiven another number, an order in the Book of Allah, it is indeed the capable, the chosen command. And when you want to pray, turn your faces towards the most holy, the sacred place, which God has made the circuit of the highest assembly and the face of the people of the cities of eternity, and the source of the command for those in the two earths and the heavens. And at the sunset of the truth and clarification, the place which we have determined for you, it is indeed the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>7 Everything has been fulfilled by His decree when the sun of the judgments rises from the horizon of the statement, it is upon everyone to follow it, even if by order, the skies of the hearts of religions would burst open from it. Indeed, He does what He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. And what the beloved has ruled is indeed beloved and the owner of invention. The one who found has recognized the Merciful and recognized the rise of this statement, indeed, he would receive arrows in his eyes to establish the judgments among people. Blessed is the one who accepted and won by the separation of the speech.</p>

<p>10 Prayer and fasting have been ordained for you from the onset of puberty, a command from your Lord and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Whoever has weakness in him due to illness or old age, God has forgiven him, a favor from Him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God has permitted you to prostrate on anything pure, and we have lifted from it the judgment of the limit in the book. Indeed, God knows and you do not know. Whoever does not find water, he mentions five times “in the name of Allah, the purest, the purest”, then he commences the work. This is what the Lord of the worlds and the countries where the nights and the days are long have ruled. So let them pray by the hours and the aspects from which the times have been determined.

<p>14 And for you and for them in journeys, when you settle and find a secure place, let each prayer be a single prostration and remember in it, “Glory be to Allah, the possessor of greatness, majesty, endowment, and favors”. And whoever is unable to say “Glory be to Allah”, it is sufficient for him with the truth. Indeed, He is the sufficient, the everlasting, the forgiving, the merciful.</p>
<p>After completing the prostration, you and they should sit on the structure of monotheism and say eighteen times, “Glory be to Allah, the possessor of sovereignty and the kingdom.” Thus does Allah clarify the paths of truth and guidance, and indeed, they lead to one way, which is this straight path. Thank Allah for this great favor. Praise Allah for this endowment that encompasses the heavens and the earth. Remember Allah for this mercy that has preceded the worlds.</p>
<p>15 Say, “Indeed, Allah has made the key to the hidden treasure my love. If you knew, without the key, it would remain concealed in the eternity of pre-existence, if you truly knew. Say, this is the source of revelation and the dawn of illumination, by which all horizons are lit, if you truly understood.

<section id="inheritance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>
<p>20 We have divided the inheritance according to the number of the letter ز (Za). This was decreed for your offspring in the book of ط (Ta) according to the number of مقت (displeasure). For the spouses, it was decided in the book of ح (Ha) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ف (Fa). For the fathers, it was written in the book of ز (Za) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ك (Kaf).</p>
<p>For the mothers, it was determined in the book of و (Waw) according to the number of رفيع (exalted). For the brothers, it was mentioned in the book of ه (Ha) the number of ش (Shin). For the sisters, it was stated in the book of د (Dal) the number of ر (Ra) and م (Meem). For the teachers, it was noted in the book of ج (Jeem) the number of ق (Qaf) and ف (Fa).</p>
<p>This is how it was judged by the heralds who mention Me in the nights and at dawn. When we heard the noise of the offspring in the loins, we doubled what was for them and reduced from the other. He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, and He does with His authority as He pleases.</p>
<p>21 If someone passes away and has no offspring, their rights revert back to the House of Justice so that the trustees of the Merciful may distribute it among orphans, widows, and what benefits the majority of the people, so they may give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>22 And for the one who has offspring but does not have what was specified in the scripture, two-thirds of what he left go to his offspring and one-third goes to the House of Justice. Thus is the decree of the Mighty, the Supreme in dignity and grandeur.</p>
<p>23 And for the one who has no inheritors but has close relatives from the children of his brother, sister, and their daughters, they receive two-thirds. If not, it goes to the paternal uncles, aunts, maternal uncles, aunts, and those after them, to their sons and daughters. The remaining one-third goes back to the House of Justice. This is a decree in the scripture from Allah, the owner of all souls.</p>
<p>24 Whoever dies without any of the designated inheritors as per the divine decree from the Most High Pen, all of their wealth is returned to the aforementioned House of Justice, to be distributed as per God’s command. Indeed, He is the All-Powerful, the Commander.</p>
<p>25 We have designated the inhabited dwelling and the specific clothing for the male descendants, not the females, and the inheritors. Indeed, He is the Bestower, the Overflowing.</p>
<p>26 Indeed, those who die during their father’s lifetime and have descendants, they will inherit what belongs to their father as written in the Book of Allah. Distribute among them with pure justice. Thus, the sea of speech has surged and cast forth the pearls of judgments from the Sovereign of all beings.</p>
<p>27 And for those who leave behind weak descendants, hand over their inheritance to a trustworthy guardian who will invest it for them until they reach maturity or the stipulated partnership age. Then, assign the guardian a right from what has been gained from the trade and business.</p>
<p>28 All of this is to be done after the payment of Allah’s right, if there are any debts on the deceased, and the preparation of means for shrouding and burial, and carrying the deceased with dignity and honor. Thus, is the decree of the Master of the Beginning and the End.</p>
<p>29 Say: This is the hidden knowledge that will not change, for it began with the ‘Ta’ symbolizing the stored name, the Manifest, the Forbidden, the Impenetrable. And what we have designated for the offspring is from Allah’s favor upon them, so they may thank their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. These are the limits set by Allah, do not transgress them by your own desires. Follow what you have been commanded from the source of the statement, and the sincere ones see the boundaries of Allah as the water of life for the people of religions, and the lamp of wisdom and success for those on the earth and in the heavens.</p>

They should act as trustees of the Merciful among possibilities and as deputies of Allah for all who are on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants for the sake of Allah, just as they consult on their own affairs, and choose what is most select.

<p>Do not waste your time in idleness and laziness, but engage in that which benefits yourselves and others.

<p>36 Among people, there are those who humble themselves like the straps of sandals, seeking the chest of glory. Say, “Who are you, O negligent and deceitful one?” And among them are those who claim to comprehend the innermost and the innermost of the innermost. Say, “O liar, by God, you have nothing. Indeed, it is the outer layers that we have left for you, just as bones are left for dogs. By God, the truth is, if one were to wash the feet of the world and worship God in the thickets, the wilderness, the mountains, the valleys, and the hilltops, and at every stone, tree, meadow, and never deviates from it, my approval would never be accepted.” This is what the Lord of all beings has decreed.</p>
<p>How many a servant has secluded himself in the islands of India, depriving himself of what God has permitted him, enduring hardships and tribulations, yet does not mention before God the station of the signs. Do not make your actions a partnership of hopes, and do not deprive yourselves of this goal, which was the hope of the near ones in the primordial past. Say, “The spirit of actions is my satisfaction, and everything is contingent upon my acceptance.” Read the tablets so you may know what is intended in the books of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Whoever succeeds in my love, it is his right to sit on the bed of contentment in the heart of existence. As for the one who is deprived, even if he were to sit on the ground, he seeks refuge from it with God, the Lord of all religions.</p>

If they persist in their claim, a merciless punishment will befall them, for He is severe in retribution. Anyone who interprets or explains this verse in a way that deviates from its apparent meaning is deprived of God’s Spirit and His mercy, which predated all worlds. Fear God and do not follow your illusions. Comply with what your Mighty and Wise Lord instructs you. The uproar will emerge from most lands.

We have made it the focus of the world for My remembrance, but you have discarded the mentioned one as it emerged in the Kingdom of your God, the Lord of all worlds. We have been with you in all conditions and found you clinging to the branch, oblivious of the root. Indeed, your Lord bears witness to what I say.</p>
<p>Our hearts are filled with sorrow at seeing you revolving around Our name, yet not recognizing Us before your face. Open your eyes, so you may behold this noble sight, recognize the One you call upon in nights and days, and see the luminous light emerging from this gleaming horizon.</p>

<p>86 Say, O King of Berlin, hear the call from this manifest temple that there is no deity but Me, the Everlasting, the Single, the Ancient. Beware that arrogance prevents you from the dawn of manifestation or desire veils you from the Owner of the heavens and the earth. So advises you the Most High Pen, for He is the Gracious, the Generous. Remember those who were greater than you in status and higher than you in rank, where are they and what is with them? Be alert and do not be among those who are asleep. Indeed, he rejected the Tablet of God and saw it when we informed him of what was brought upon us by the armies of the oppressors.</p>
<p>Therefore, humiliation overtook him from all sides until he returned to dust with great loss. O King, reflect upon him and upon others like you who mocked the lands and ruled over the people. The Merciful has brought them down from the palaces to the graves. Take a lesson and be among those who remember.</p>
<p>87 Indeed, we seek nothing from you. We only advise you for the sake of God and we patiently endure as we endured what has come upon us from you, O assembly of sovereigns.</p>

<p>139 Then, consider what has been revealed in another status, hoping that you might invoke what you possess, turning towards Allah, the Lord of the worlds. It was stated that it is not permissible for a union unless it is explicitly stipulated in the statement. If one party enters into the union, it becomes forbidden for the other party to exercise what they possess from their end unless that is reverted after a command has been elevated from what we have made apparent in truth, or what has appeared justly. Before that happens, you should strive to approach it, hoping that by doing so, you elevate the command of Allah. Thus, the leaves rustled on the branches, mentioning their Merciful Lord. Blessed are those who listen.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-god-changes-the-laws">Why God Changes the Laws</h2>
<p>140 O assembly of the statements, I swear you by your Lord, the Merciful, to look at what has been revealed in truth with an eye of fairness and not to be among those who see the evidence of God and deny it. Indeed, they are the ones who are ruined. The point of the statement has been clearly articulated in this verse by the elevation of my command before his command. Every fair and knowledgeable person bears witness to that. As you see it today, it has risen to a status that is only denied by those whose vision has been blurred in the past and in the future. For them, there is a humiliating punishment.</p>
<p>141 Say, “By Allah, indeed I am beloved, and now listen to what descends from the heavens of revelation and lament for what you have committed in its days. Fear Allah, and do not be among the transgressors.</p>
<p>Say, ’O people, if you do not believe in it, do not oppose it. By Allah, what has gathered against it from the armies of the oppressors is sufficient.”</p>
<p>142 Indeed, some rules have been revealed so that the Supreme Pen may not move in this revelation except to mention His lofty stations and His most beautiful view. When We wanted to show favor, We detailed it with the truth and lightened what We intended for you. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the Noble.</p>
<p>143 I have informed you before about what this Wise Reminder speaks. It says, the truthful word, “that it speaks in every matter that ‘there is no god but Me, the Unique, the Singular, the Knowledgeable, the Aware.’”</p>
<p>This is a station that God has specifically assigned to this inaccessible, wondrous revelation. This is from the grace of God if you are among those who understand. This is from His definitive command, His greatest name, His highest word, and the rise of His most beautiful names if you are among the knowledgeable ones. Indeed, with it, the sunrises and the easts become visible. Reflect, O people, on what has been revealed with truth, and contemplate on it, and do not be among the transgressors.</p>

If anyone causes sorrow to another, they must compensate with nineteen weights of gold. This is the ruling of the Master of the worlds. He has pardoned you in this appearance (revelation) and advises you to righteousness and piety, an order from Him in this enlightening tablet. Do not wish for anyone what you would not wish for yourself. Fear God and do not be among the arrogant. All of you were created from water and will return to the soil. Reflect on your consequences and do not be among the wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Listen to what the lote tree recites to you from the verses of God. Indeed, it is a criterion of guidance from God, the Lord of the hereafter and the first [life]. By it, souls fly to the source of revelation and the hearts of those facing [God] are illuminated. These are the boundaries of God, which are imposed on you. These are the orders of God, you are commanded to abide by them in the tablet. Act with spirit and fragrance; this is better for you if you are among those who understand.</p>

<p>Do not let the abundance of reading and deeds in the night and day deceive you. If one recites a verse from the verses with spirit and fragrance, it is better for him than to recite with laziness the scriptures of God, the Guardian, the Sustainer. Recite the verses of God to your capacity. Do not let laziness and sadness overcome you. Do not burden the souls with what makes them lethargic and heavy, but lighten them so that they may fly with the wings of the verses to the source of clarity. This is closer to God, if you understand.</p>

Break the chains of illusions in the name of the Sovereign of Mankind and do not be among the deceivers. When you turn towards Allah and enter this matter, do not cause corruption therein, nor measure Allah’s book by your desires. This is the advice of Allah before and after. The witnesses of Allah and His chosen ones bear witness to this. Verily, we all are witnesses to it.</p>
<p>166 Remember the elder who was named Muhammad, before Hassan, and he was among the most knowledgeable scholars in his time. When the truth appeared, he and his likes turned away from it, and those who separated the wheat from the barley turned to Allah. He, on his claim, wrote down the laws of Allah night and day. But when the Chosen One came, not a letter of it benefited him. If it had benefited him, he would not have turned away from the face which illuminated the faces of the close ones.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choose-a-language-and-script-a-cause-of-unity">Choose a Language and Script, a Cause of Unity</h3>
<p>189 O people of the councils in the lands, choose a language from the languages to be spoken on earth and so too from the scripts. Indeed, God clarifies for you what benefits you and makes you self-sufficient from others. Indeed, He is the Most Generous, the All-Knowing, the Well-Informed. This is the cause of unity if you know, and the major reason for agreement and civilization if you feel. We have made these two matters as signs for reaching the first world, which is the greatest foundation. We revealed it in other tablets, and the second one was revealed in this extraordinary tablet.</p>
