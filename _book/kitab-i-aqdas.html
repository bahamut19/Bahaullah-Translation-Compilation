<section id="recognize-his-revelation-and-follow-his-command" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recognize-his-revelation-and-follow-his-command">Recognize His Revelation and Follow His Command</h2>
<p>1 Indeed, the first thing that God wrote for the servants is the recognition of His luminous revelation and the rise of His command, which was the status of His soul in the world of command and creation. Whoever wins it has won all the good. And the one who is prevented, indeed, he is among the people of misguidance, even if he comes with all the deeds. If you have won this highest status and the highest horizon, it is appropriate for every soul to follow what was ordered from the intended one, for both together do not accept one without the other. This is what was ruled by the rise of inspiration.</p>
<p>2 Indeed, those who were given insights by God, they see God’s limits, the greatest reason for the order of the world and the preservation of nations. And the one who was negligent, indeed, he is among the savages. We have commanded you to break the boundaries of self and desire, not what was numbered by the highest pen. It is the spirit of life for whoever is possible. The oceans of wisdom and expression have roared with what the breath of mercy has stirred. Seize it, O people of understanding. Those who have broken God’s covenant in his commands and turned back on their heels, those are among the people of misguidance in the presence of the rich, the exalted.</p>
<p>3 O people of the Earth, know that my orders are the lamp of my care among my servants and the keys of my mercy for my creatures. Thus, the order was revealed from the sky of the will of your Lord, the owner of religions. If someone finds the sweetness of the explanation that appeared from the mouth of the will of the merciful, he would spend what he has, even if it were all the treasures of the Earth, to establish an order from his shining orders from the horizon of care and kindness.</p>
<p>4 Say, whoever passes by my boundaries recognizes my shirt and with it the banners of victory are raised over the canons and submission. My power’s tongue has spoken in the greatness of my majesty, addressing my creatures, that they should love my boundaries for my beauty. Blessed is the lover who recognized the beloved from this word that exudes the breezes of grace, which cannot be described by remembrances. By my life, whoever drinks the nectar of justice from the hands of kindness, he orbits around my radiant orders from the horizon of creativity.</p>
<p>5 Do not think that we have revealed to you only the judgments. Rather, we have opened the seal of the sealed nectar with the fingers of power and capability. This is attested by what was revealed from the pen of revelation. Reflect on this, O people of thoughts.</p>
</section>
<section id="prayer-and-fasting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prayer-and-fasting">Prayer and Fasting</h2>
<p>6 Prayer has been prescribed for you, nine prostrations for Allah, the revealer of the verses, at noon, and in the early morning and evening. And we have forgiven another number, an order in the Book of Allah, it is indeed the capable, the chosen command. And when you want to pray, turn your faces towards the most holy, the sacred place, which God has made the circuit of the highest assembly and the face of the people of the cities of eternity, and the source of the command for those in the two earths and the heavens. And at the sunset of the truth and clarification, the place which we have determined for you, it is indeed the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>7 Everything has been fulfilled by His decree when the sun of the judgments rises from the horizon of the statement, it is upon everyone to follow it, even if by order, the skies of the hearts of religions would burst open from it. Indeed, He does what He wills and is not questioned about what He wills. And what the beloved has ruled is indeed beloved and the owner of invention. The one who found has recognized the Merciful and recognized the rise of this statement, indeed, he would receive arrows in his eyes to establish the judgments among people. Blessed is the one who accepted and won by the separation of the speech.</p>
<p>8 We have detailed the prayer in another document. Blessed is the one who acts according to what was ordered from the owner of the necks. Six takbirs have been revealed in the prayer for the dead, from Allah, the revealer of the verses, and the one who has the knowledge of reading, he should read what was revealed before them, otherwise, God has forgiven him, indeed, He is the Mighty, the Forgiver.</p>
<p>9 Hair does not invalidate your prayer, nor what is prevented from the spirit such as bones and the like. Wear fur as you wear silk and squirrel, and what is less than them, it was not forbidden in the Quran, but it has been confused for the scholars. Indeed, He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>10 Prayer and fasting have been ordained for you from the onset of puberty, a command from your Lord and the Lord of your earliest ancestors. Whoever has weakness in him due to illness or old age, God has forgiven him, a favor from Him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God has permitted you to prostrate on anything pure, and we have lifted from it the judgment of the limit in the book. Indeed, God knows and you do not know. Whoever does not find water, he mentions five times “in the name of Allah, the purest, the purest”, then he commences the work. This is what the Lord of the worlds and the countries where the nights and the days are long have ruled. So let them pray by the hours and the aspects from which the times have been determined. Indeed, He is the Clear, the Wise.</p>
<p>11 We have pardoned you for the prayer of the verses when they appear, remember Allah with greatness and power. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing. Say, the greatness is for Allah, Lord of what is seen and what is not seen, Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>12 The prayer has been ordained for you individually, the judgment of congregation has been lifted except in the funeral prayer. Indeed, He is the Wise in command.</p>
<p>13 Allah has pardoned women when they find blood from fasting and prayer, and they should perform ablution and glorify Him ninety-five times from noon to noon, “glorified is Allah of the rising and the beauty.” This is what has been ordained in the book if you are among the knowledgeable.</p>
<p>14 And for you and for them in journeys, when you settle and find a secure place, let each prayer be a single prostration and remember in it, “Glory be to Allah, the possessor of greatness, majesty, endowment, and favors”. And whoever is unable to say “Glory be to Allah”, it is sufficient for him with the truth. Indeed, He is the sufficient, the everlasting, the forgiving, the merciful.</p>
<p>After completing the prostration, you and they should sit on the structure of monotheism and say eighteen times, “Glory be to Allah, the possessor of sovereignty and the kingdom.” Thus does Allah clarify the paths of truth and guidance, and indeed, they lead to one way, which is this straight path. Thank Allah for this great favor. Praise Allah for this endowment that encompasses the heavens and the earth. Remember Allah for this mercy that has preceded the worlds.</p>
<p>15 Say, “Indeed, Allah has made the key to the hidden treasure my love. If you knew, without the key, it would remain concealed in the eternity of pre-existence, if you truly knew. Say, this is the source of revelation and the dawn of illumination, by which all horizons are lit, if you truly understood. Indeed, this is the confirmed decree, and by it every predetermined decree is established.”</p>
<p>16 O Supreme Pen, say, “O people! We have prescribed fasting for you for a fixed number of days and have made the New Year a celebration for you after its completion. Thus, the sun of clarification has risen from the book’s horizon by the command of the Originator and the Returner.</p>
<p>Make the additional days before the month of fasting, which we have made manifestations of the letter “Ha” among the nights and days. When defined by the borders of the year and the months, the people of glory should feed themselves, their relatives, then the poor and the needy, and they should celebrate, glorify, praise, and magnify their Lord in joy and happiness.</p>
<p>When the days of giving before restraint have been completed, they should enter into fasting. This is the decree of the Lord of the people. There is no hardship upon the traveler, the sick, the pregnant, and the nursing. Allah has excused them as a favor from Him, for He is the Mighty, the Bestower.”</p>
<p>17 These are the limits of Allah, which are inscribed by the Supreme Pen in the parchment and the tablets. Hold firmly to the commands and judgments of Allah, and do not be among those who take the roots of their selves and discard the roots of Allah behind their backs because they have followed their suspicions and illusions.</p>
<p>Refrain yourselves from eating and drinking from sunrise to sunset. Beware that your desires do not prevent you from this bounty, which has been determined in the book.</p>
<section id="ablutions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ablutions">Ablutions</h3>
<p>18 It has been decreed for those who believe in Allah, the Judge, to wash their hands and then their faces every day. Then they should sit facing Allah and recite ninety-five times, “Allah is the most glorious.” This is the command of the Creator of the sky, Who has established Himself on the throne of names with majesty and power. Thus, you should perform ablution for the prayer, a command from Allah, the One, the Chosen.</p>

<section id="inheritance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inheritance">Inheritance</h3>
<p>20 We have divided the inheritance according to the number of the letter ز (Za). This was decreed for your offspring in the book of ط (Ta) according to the number of مقت (displeasure). For the spouses, it was decided in the book of ح (Ha) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ف (Fa). For the fathers, it was written in the book of ز (Za) according to the number of ت (Ta) and ك (Kaf).</p>
<p>For the mothers, it was determined in the book of و (Waw) according to the number of رفيع (exalted). For the brothers, it was mentioned in the book of ه (Ha) the number of ش (Shin). For the sisters, it was stated in the book of د (Dal) the number of ر (Ra) and م (Meem). For the teachers, it was noted in the book of ج (Jeem) the number of ق (Qaf) and ف (Fa).</p>
<p>This is how it was judged by the heralds who mention Me in the nights and at dawn. When we heard the noise of the offspring in the loins, we doubled what was for them and reduced from the other. He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, and He does with His authority as He pleases.</p>
<p>21 If someone passes away and has no offspring, their rights revert back to the House of Justice so that the trustees of the Merciful may distribute it among orphans, widows, and what benefits the majority of the people, so they may give thanks to their Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving.</p>
<p>22 And for the one who has offspring but does not have what was specified in the scripture, two-thirds of what he left go to his offspring and one-third goes to the House of Justice. Thus is the decree of the Mighty, the Supreme in dignity and grandeur.</p>
<p>23 And for the one who has no inheritors but has close relatives from the children of his brother, sister, and their daughters, they receive two-thirds. If not, it goes to the paternal uncles, aunts, maternal uncles, aunts, and those after them, to their sons and daughters. The remaining one-third goes back to the House of Justice. This is a decree in the scripture from Allah, the owner of all souls.</p>
<p>24 Whoever dies without any of the designated inheritors as per the divine decree from the Most High Pen, all of their wealth is returned to the aforementioned House of Justice, to be distributed as per God’s command. Indeed, He is the All-Powerful, the Commander.</p>
<p>25 We have designated the inhabited dwelling and the specific clothing for the male descendants, not the females, and the inheritors. Indeed, He is the Bestower, the Overflowing.</p>
<p>26 Indeed, those who die during their father’s lifetime and have descendants, they will inherit what belongs to their father as written in the Book of Allah. Distribute among them with pure justice. Thus, the sea of speech has surged and cast forth the pearls of judgments from the Sovereign of all beings.</p>
<p>27 And for those who leave behind weak descendants, hand over their inheritance to a trustworthy guardian who will invest it for them until they reach maturity or the stipulated partnership age. Then, assign the guardian a right from what has been gained from the trade and business.</p>
<p>28 All of this is to be done after the payment of Allah’s right, if there are any debts on the deceased, and the preparation of means for shrouding and burial, and carrying the deceased with dignity and honor. Thus, is the decree of the Master of the Beginning and the End.</p>
<p>29 Say: This is the hidden knowledge that will not change, for it began with the ‘Ta’ symbolizing the stored name, the Manifest, the Forbidden, the Impenetrable. And what we have designated for the offspring is from Allah’s favor upon them, so they may thank their Lord, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. These are the limits set by Allah, do not transgress them by your own desires. Follow what you have been commanded from the source of the statement, and the sincere ones see the boundaries of Allah as the water of life for the people of religions, and the lamp of wisdom and success for those on the earth and in the heavens.</p>

<section id="the-house-of-justice" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-house-of-justice">The House of Justice</h3>
<p>30 Allah has decreed for every city to establish a House of Justice where souls gather in number equal to ‘Bahá’ (9), and if it increases, there is no harm. They should feel as though they are entering the presence of Allah, the Most High, the Supreme, seeing Him who is unseen. They should act as trustees of the Merciful among possibilities and as deputies of Allah for all who are on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants for the sake of Allah, just as they consult on their own affairs, and choose what is most select. Such is the decree of your Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiving. Beware of neglecting what is specified in the Tablet. Fear Allah, O people of insight.</p>

<p>33 O people of Baha, it is obligatory for each of you to engage in some form of occupation, such as crafts, farming, and the like. We have regarded your engagement in these as equivalent to worship for God, the Truth. Reflect, O people, on the mercy of God and His grace, then thank Him at dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>Do not waste your time in idleness and laziness, but engage in that which benefits yourselves and others. Thus has the matter been decreed in this Tablet, from whose horizon has shone the sun of wisdom and explanation. The most despised of people before God are those who sit idle and beg. Grasp the rope of means, relying on God, the Cause of causes.</p>

<p>35 O servants of the Merciful, stand up in service of the command, no matter the situation, lest grief from those who disbelieve in the appearance of the signs overtake you. When the promise came and what was promised became apparent, people disagreed and each party clung to what they had of conjectures and illusions.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-not-deprive-yourself-of-what-god-allows">Do Not Deprive Yourself of What God Allows</h3>
<p>36 Among people, there are those who humble themselves like the straps of sandals, seeking the chest of glory. Say, “Who are you, O negligent and deceitful one?” And among them are those who claim to comprehend the innermost and the innermost of the innermost. Say, “O liar, by God, you have nothing. Indeed, it is the outer layers that we have left for you, just as bones are left for dogs. By God, the truth is, if one were to wash the feet of the world and worship God in the thickets, the wilderness, the mountains, the valleys, and the hilltops, and at every stone, tree, meadow, and never deviates from it, my approval would never be accepted.” This is what the Lord of all beings has decreed.</p>
<p>How many a servant has secluded himself in the islands of India, depriving himself of what God has permitted him, enduring hardships and tribulations, yet does not mention before God the station of the signs. Do not make your actions a partnership of hopes, and do not deprive yourselves of this goal, which was the hope of the near ones in the primordial past. Say, “The spirit of actions is my satisfaction, and everything is contingent upon my acceptance.” Read the tablets so you may know what is intended in the books of God, the Mighty, the Bestower. Whoever succeeds in my love, it is his right to sit on the bed of contentment in the heart of existence. As for the one who is deprived, even if he were to sit on the ground, he seeks refuge from it with God, the Lord of all religions.</p>

<p>37 Whoever makes a proclamation or asserts something before the completion of a full thousand years, they are undoubtedly a liar and fabricator. We pray to God to guide them towards retraction if they express remorse. Indeed, He is the Forgiver. If they persist in their claim, a merciless punishment will befall them, for He is severe in retribution. Anyone who interprets or explains this verse in a way that deviates from its apparent meaning is deprived of God’s Spirit and His mercy, which predated all worlds. Fear God and do not follow your illusions. Comply with what your Mighty and Wise Lord instructs you. The uproar will emerge from most lands. Steer clear of it, O people, and do not follow every immoral, contemptible person. This we have informed you of when we were in Iraq, in the land of secrecy, and in this radiant scene.</p>

Rise to the defense of my cause and the elevation of my word among all the worlds. Indeed, we are with you in every circumstance, and we will support you with the truth. Indeed, we have been capable. Whoever recognizes me, shall serve me with a dedication that the armies of heavens and earth cannot deter.</p>
<p>39 Indeed, people are asleep; if they were to awaken, they would hasten with their hearts to the All-Knowing, Wise God, and discard what they have, even if it were all the treasures of the world, so that their Lord may remember them with a word from Him. This is how He informs you from Him, knowledge of the unseen in a Tablet of what has appeared in the possible and what He alone has been informed of, the One who is in charge of all the worlds.</p>
<p>The intoxication of desire has overtaken them so that they do not see the Master of the universe, whose call has risen from all directions, “There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise.”</p>

<p>40 Say, “Do not rejoice in what you have possessed in the evening and at dawn; someone else will possess it. Thus, the All-Knowing, the Expert informs you. Say, have you seen what you have as a permanent or lasting? No, and by My Merciful Self, if you were fair, you would see your days passing like the winds and your glory folding up like that of the ancients. Contemplate, O people, where are your past days and where are your wasted times. Blessed are the days that passed in the remembrance of God, and the times that were spent in His wise remembrance.</p>
<p>By My Life, there will be no glory for the mighty, no adornments for the rich, no thorns for the wretched. Everything will perish by a word from Him, for He is the Capable, the Mighty, the Powerful. What people have of furnishings does not benefit them, and they have been negligent of what would benefit them. They will become aware and will not find what they have missed in the days of their Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. If they knew, they would spend what they have to remember their names by the Throne, but they are among the dead.”</p>
<p>41 Among the people are those who are deceived by their knowledge, and with it, they are barred from my everlasting name. When they hear the sound of footsteps behind them, they see themselves greater than Nimrod. Say, “Where is he, O you who are rejected? By God, he is indeed in the depths of Hell.</p>
<p>Say, “O assembly of scholars, do you not hear the creaking of my supreme pen, and do not you see this rising sun from the most glorious horizon? Why do you stay attached to the idols of your whims? Leave your illusions and turn towards God, your ancient master.”</p>

No one has the right to dispose of them except after permission from the source of revelation, and after him, the decision reverts to the branches, and after them to the House of Justice, once its order is established in the lands, so that they may spend it in the elevated lands in this matter and in what they have been commanded by the potent, capable one.</p>
<p>Otherwise, they should revert to the people of Bahá, who do not speak except after his permission, and do not rule except by what God has ruled in this Tablet. These are the supporters of victory between the heavens and the earth, to spend it on what has been specified in the Book from a Mighty, Generous one.</p>

<p>78 O assembly of kings, the Sovereign has come and the kingdom belongs to Allah, the Guardian, the Everlasting. Worship none but Allah, and direct your hearts, illuminated, towards the face of your Lord, the Master of Names. This command is incomparable to what you have, if indeed you understand.</p>
<p>79 Indeed, We see you rejoice in what you have gathered for others, yet depriving yourselves of the worlds that none but the Preserved Tablet has enumerated. Wealth has distracted you from the ultimate purpose; this is not befitting for you, if only you knew. Purify your hearts from the dregs of the world, hastening towards the dominion of your Lord, the Originator of the earth and the heavens, by whom the earthquakes have appeared and the tribes have lamented. Except those who have rejected the masses and embraced what has been commanded in the hidden Tablet.</p>
<p>80 This is a day when the speaker triumphs with the lights of the Ancient One and drinks the crystal clear waters of union from this cup that stirred the oceans. Say, by God, the truth is that the Mount orbits around the place of appearance, and the spirit calls from the dominion, “Come forth and ascend, O sons of vanity.”</p>
<p>This is a day when the mountain of God rushed with longing for His meeting and Zion cried out, “The promise has come, and what was written in the Tablets of God, the Most High, the Mighty, the Beloved, has appeared.”</p>
<p>81 O assembly of kings, the Greater Law has been revealed in the luminous scene, and every hidden matter has appeared from the hands of the Master of Destiny. By Him, the Hour has come, the moon has split, and every decreed matter has been detailed.</p>
<p>82 O assembly of kings, you are the subjects, the Sovereign has appeared in the most beautiful design and invites you to Himself, the Preserver, the Sustainer. Beware that arrogance does not prevent you from the rising place of Manifestation, or that the world does not veil you from the Creator of the heavens. Rise to serve the Intended One, who created you with a Word from Himself and made you the manifestations of power for what has been and what will be.</p>
<p>83 By God, we do not wish to interfere in your kingdoms, but we have come to change hearts, for they are the mirrors of glory. The kingdom of names bears witness to this if you understand. And he who follows his Lord indeed turns away from the entire world, and how commendable is this praised position! Leave your homes and then turn to the kingdom. This is what benefits you in the hereafter and the first. The owner of the dominion bears witness to this if you know.</p>
<p>84 Blessed is the king who has stood for the support of My Cause in My Kingdom and has cut off from all else. Indeed, he is among the companions of the Crimson Ark, which God has made for the people of glory. It is fitting for everyone to honor him, respect him, and support him so that he may open cities with the keys of My Dominant Name to those in the kingdoms of the unseen and witnessed.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is like the vision for the humans, the most resplendent luminary for the forehead of creation, and the head of generosity for the body of the world. O people of glory, support him with your wealth and souls.</p>

<p>94 O Land of ‘Kh’, we hear within you the voice of men in the remembrance of your Lord, the Self-Sufficient, the Most High. Blessed be the day when the banners of the Names will be hoisted in the Kingdom of Creation with My most glorious Name. On that day, the faithful will rejoice with the victory of God, and the polytheists will mourn.</p>
<p>95 No one should interfere with those who govern over the people. Leave what they have to them and turn your attention towards the hearts.</p>
<p>96 O Great Sea, shower upon the nations what you have been commanded by the Eternal Sovereign, and adorn the temples of humanity with the patterns of wisdom that gladden hearts and delight eyes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purify-your-wealth">Purify Your Wealth</h2>
<p>97 And he who possesses a hundred weights of gold, nineteen weights are for God, the Creator of the earth and the heavens. Beware, O people, not to withhold yourselves from this immense bounty. We have commanded you this after being independent of you and everyone in the heavens and earth. Indeed, in this is a decree and benefits which no one has knowledge of except God, the Knowing, the Informed. Say, it is intended to purify your wealth and bring you closer to stations that none can reach except by the will of God. He is indeed the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous. O people, do not be unfaithful in the rights of God and do not dispense it except with His permission. So is the decree in the Tablets and in this impregnable Tablet. Whoever betrays God is met with just retribution, and he who acts as commanded receives blessings from the sky of his Lord’s generous gift, the Giver, the Provider, the Ancient.</p>
<p>He intends for you what you do not know today, people will know when the spirits soar and the carpets of joy are folded. Thus, he reminds you from him is an inscribed Tablet.</p>
<p>98 Various petitions have arrived at the Throne from those who believed and they asked God, the Lord of what can be seen and what cannot be seen, the Lord of the Worlds. Therefore, we revealed the Tablet and adorned it with the design of the Command so that people might act in accordance with their Lord’s rulings. Likewise, we were asked before in consecutive years and we withheld the Pen, a wisdom from Us, until numbered souls were present in those days. Therefore, we answered them with the truth, with what gives life to hearts.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-the-assembly-of-scholars">To the Assembly of Scholars</h2>
<p>99 Say, O assembly of scholars, do not weigh the Book of God against your own principles and sciences. It is indeed the balance of truth among creation. What is with the nations is to be weighed by this great balance, and it by itself, if you but knew.</p>
<p>100 My watchful eye weeps for you, because you have not recognized the One you invoke in the dusk and dawn, and at every sunset and sunrise. Turn, O people, with bright faces and radiant hearts towards the blessed crimson spot where the Lote Tree of the ultimate end proclaims, “There is no deity but I, the Overseer, the Self-Sustaining.”</p>
<p>101 O assembly of scholars, can any of you dare to engage with me in the arena of unveiling and gnosis, or to traverse the track of wisdom and explanation? No, by my Lord, the Compassionate, all upon it shall perish, and this is the countenance of your beloved and mighty Lord.</p>

<section id="to-the-people" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-the-people">To the People</h2>
<p>102 O people, we have indeed ordained knowledge for the recognition of the Known, yet you have used it to veil yourselves from its source, from which every concealed matter has been revealed. If you truly understood the horizon from which the sun of discourse has risen, you would abandon creation and all that is with them, and you would turn to the praised station.</p>
<p>103 Say, this is the sky in which the mother of the book, the source of all knowledge, is contained if you truly comprehend. This is the one with which the rock cried out and the Lote-Tree called out on the elevated mount, on the blessed land. Sovereignty belongs to God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Loving.</p>
