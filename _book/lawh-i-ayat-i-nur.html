<p>In the name of God, the Glorious, the Most Glorious.</p>
<section id="the-letters-were-created" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-letters-were-created">The Letters Were Created</h2>
<p>1) Praise be to God who created the letters in the worlds of obscurity, behind the veils of sanctity, in the heights of the Most Exalted. He then nourished them from the chalices of perpetuity, as He had ordained in the Tablets of Decree, to revive the hearts of those drawn near in the realm of execution. He then clothed them with the garment of blackness, according to His eternal predestination, in the hidden recesses of destiny, upon the crimson domes, surpassing all prior knowledge, so as to conceal the water of life in the darkness of the realms of names at the Lote Tree of the Limit. Then He sent them down to the realm of creation in the air of destiny.</p>
<section id="the-dot-was-manifested-after-140000-years" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dot-was-manifested-after-140000-years">The Dot Was Manifested After 140,000 Years</h3>
<p>2) Then the voice emerged from the Most High abode, addressing the First Pen, saying, “O Pen, write from the secrets of the Ancient onto the luminous white tablet.” Upon hearing this call, the Pen swooned in yearning for seventy thousand years beyond what the counters could count. When it revived, as determined by the divine decree, it wept for another seventy thousand years with tears of crimson. Then it stood before God in a time that was preceded by the ruling of the Primordial Beginning and is not followed by the ruling of the Ultimate End. When it was burned by the fire of separation after the sweet call ceased, its tears took on the color of blackness in the realm of fidelity. A drop of these black tears fell onto the tablet. Then appeared the dot in the world of origination. This dot manifested itself with the embroidery of the Primordial in the mirrors of the letters within the realities of the names.</p>
<p>3) Then the Alif received it before all other letters in the scattering of things and detailed this divine dot in the embroidery of this eternal Alif, as the breezes of the Merciful blew upon it from the source of Oneness. Then the face of unity was unveiled behind the green veils, and the structure of the dot appeared in the form of Alif and stood on the tablet as it stood upon the command of the Most High God in the world of attributes and names. This is the station where the essence of Will wore the robe of Nomenclature and shed the attire of Qualities in the city of Grandeur.</p>
<p>4) When this standing Alif settled on the luminous tablet, it manifested in a manifestation of other innovations. Then the disconnected letters appeared at the beginning of manifestations to indicate the worlds of individuation and the command in the stalks of creation. Then, from these letters that appeared and shone from the primal Alif at the beginning of manifestations, emerged the worlds of determination and multiplicities. When they detailed, dispersed, and fragmented, then gathered, harmonized, mixed, and combined, then appeared the compound words and composite letters in the worlds of creation, in the structures of names and attributes.</p>
<p>5) Thus, the worlds of sovereignty were completed, and the mysteries of power were established in the manifestations of existents, so that all may indicate through the language of beings that He is the everlasting, the permanent, the Creator, the capable, the mighty, the Sultan. And that ’Ali, before Muhammad, is the Manifestation of the Essence and the Manifestation of Attributes, from whom originated the possible beings, and to whom all creatures return. He is the one who, from his own self, the munificent, the soul of Rahman, created jewels and capabilities in the world of possibility, and manifestations of existents in the worlds of time and space. The mirrors reflecting Him, and the letters speaking from Him, are the first creation of God, the beginning of manifestations, and the return of servants on the Day of Calling. This is what God has favored them over the rest of creation in the worlds of eternity.</p>
<p>6) Through them, the lights have shone, the moons have appeared, the suns have illuminated, and the stars have been revealed. All speak about Him and point to Him, such that there is no difference between Him and them except that they were created by His command, sent by His will, and gathered by His power. They are the ones through whom cycles turn, spheres revolve, the trees of monotheism are planted, the fruits of individuation appear, and the rains of abstraction descend, until the point returns to its original position after its orbit around itself and reaching its place. Then, the end returns to the beginning, and at that moment, the call of the first appears from the Ultimate Tree when the sun rises once again.</p>
<p>7) This is what the leaves have sung at the axis of perpetuity on this night of oneness, in which the fire of unity is kindled from the Tree of Sinai under the shade of the name of the Primordial and the eternal secret named as the Ancient Truth in the Preserver of names. All manifestations bear witness in the secrets of the heart to the hidden, that He is the Mighty, the Able, the Dominant, the Beneficent.</p>

<section id="the-purpose-of-this-book" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-purpose-of-this-book">The Purpose of This Book</h2>
<p>8) This is a book from the “B” before the “H” to those who have believed in God and have succeeded by the lights of guidance, to bring them to the pavilion of sanctity and draw them near to the destination which none among those who disbelieved in God have reached. The structures of the names in the cities of the attributes bear witness to this, and beyond them, the angels of sanctity also testify.</p>
<p>9) Say, indeed in the singing of the leaves on the branches, and the phases of the leaves of paradise, and the undulation of the sea of oneness, and the rising of the clouds of wisdom, and the falling of the rains, and the flowing of the rivers from the stones, and the establishment of the structure of eternity upon the throne of lights are signs for those who look through the sight of God upon the realities of things. Reflect, O assembly of loved ones, on the creation of the heavens and the earth, and then on your own selves, if you are guided in the manifestations of power by the lights of guidance in the days of the face.</p>
<section id="about-secrets-none-have-preceded-in-knowing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-secrets-none-have-preceded-in-knowing">About Secrets None Have Preceded in Knowing</h3>
<p>10) And a book has come before us from the letter “Qaf,” which traveled from itself and migrated to God, the Overseer, the Sustainer, reaching the sanctified places and entering the Egypt of certainty, in the station where God’s fire blazes behind veils of light and where the lamp of oneness is ignited in a scripted lantern. Thus, they have preceded those who migrated from their homes for the love of God, over those who have not turned towards the shore of sanctity in the city that is circled by those who are near. He asked in his book about secrets that none have preceded in knowing in the realm, and whose veil has never been lifted from the face of any of the creation, and that the knowledgeable have not grasped. Therefore, listen to what calls you from the caller of the spirit in this blessed spot, beyond the whirlpool of the spirit, in the raging sea set in writing.</p>

<section id="about-the-verse-of-light" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-verse-of-light">About the Verse of Light</h2>
<p>11) Then know that what you asked about the verse of light that was revealed to Muhammad, the Messenger of God, before this verse, is beyond the grasp of scholars. Even if all the pens in God’s knowledge were used, and all the ink of destiny were exhausted to write what has been and what will be, the meanings of the letter that descended through the tongue of glory in this blessed revealed verse would not be depleted. However, I will drip upon you a droplet from the sea of knowledge and wisdom, so you may be among those who hasten to the fields of knowledge, and drink from the cups of care from the hands of the youth upon the couches of eternity.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Surah an-Nur (24:35) Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were a shining star. (This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) though no fire touched it. Light upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whom He will. And Allah speaketh to mankind in allegories, for Allah is Knower of all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<section id="moses-guided-by-the-fire-from-the-tree-of-eternity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moses-guided-by-the-fire-from-the-tree-of-eternity">Moses Guided By the Fire From the Tree of Eternity</h3>
<p>12) When Moses completed the appointed term in the land of Midian, he returned with his family and entered the wilderness of Sinai, in the valley of sanctity, to the right of the garden of Paradise, on the shore of eternity. There he heard the call from the highest abode, across the void, saying, “O Moses, look what you see; indeed, I am God, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses then covered his face out of fear of God, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Self-Sustaining. He was called again near the shore of the sea of majesty, under the crimson dome, “Raise, O Moses, your head.” When he raised it, he saw a light ignited and shining from the ultimate tree in the green valley. Then he was guided by the supreme guidance from the fire kindled from the tree of eternity. He then took off the sandals of desire and detached himself from the dominion of the Hereafter and this world. All of this was ordained by God, as you read in the tablets. Thus, his rank was elevated, his remembrance exalted, and he became among those who direct themselves by the lights of the fire toward the paths of justice. This is what was decreed for Moses, son of Imran, under the dome of time, if you indeed know.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-fire-blazed-within-muhammads-chest" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fire-blazed-within-muhammads-chest">The Fire Blazed Within Muhammad’s Chest</h3>
<p>13) Likewise, Faran of love bore witness near Faran of fire, in the sanctified Horeb and the proximity of Sinai, if you, in the scrolls of justice, with the eye of God, bear witness. So when the veils of Oneness were lifted and the lights of Unity shone in the rise of the Muhammadan light, the fire of Being was ignited for himself, in himself, by himself, and the fire of the tree blazed within his chest. Then, the tinges of love and pulls of longing took him from every direction, and he heard the call of God from the tree of Man in his secret, stating that you are God, the Sovereign, the Overseer, the Mighty, the Holy. This was decreed in the wilderness of the Spirit for Muhammad, in the station to which no hearts of those before could ever approach. Thus, we recount to you from the secrets of knowledge and gems of wisdom, so perhaps people will kindle and flare up with the fire of God in the tree of remembrance.</p>
<p>14) When Muhammad, the Messenger of God, intended to mention this highest station, to acquaint them with the secrets of Unity in the tree of his self, and to inform them of his independence from the fire that manifested in the Sinai of wisdom upon Moses, God revealed to him this Tauric verse to serve as a guide for those who were given the Torah, and as guidance for those guided by the lights of guidance in the Muhammadan Lote Tree. And God commanded Moses to give good tidings to the people about this Sinai in this Ahmadine locale and bear witness to that which was revealed in the Book. Indeed, we sent Moses with Our signs to bring the people from darkness into light, so give them good tidings of the days of God. This is what was inscribed in the Tablets, if you are aware. Indeed, he who gives good tidings to the people about His days, how does one reach His station, if you perceive.</p>
<p>15) Then know that Moses, with what he found comfort in from the fire of the tree on the bank of the valley of Security, was guided by it and was among those who, by God’s permission, enter into the blessed locale. And Muhammad, before finding comfort in anything or being touched by any fire, was made light for those in the heavens and the earth, and guided with this light whomever He willed among His creation. This is what is inscribed in the Book, which you read in the Criterion.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-lamp-and-the-glass" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lamp-and-the-glass">The Lamp and the Glass</h3>
<p>16) Then know that the station of the niche in this verse is the same, and the lamp is his illuminated heart, and the glass is his holy structure within which the lamp of Oneness is lit. From it the light is kindled and shines, and by it, everyone in the heavens and the earth is illuminated. Thus, we mention to you, if by this light you are illuminated in the days of the spirit.</p>
<p>17) Then after this light has been illuminated in the lamp of Muhammadan essence and kindled upon the niche of the Ahmadan essence, and the creation of Oneness has been completed in the structure of sanctity, God commanded to remind people of His meeting in the otherworldly resurrection. He gives them good news of the praiseworthy sanctified station in the abode where the assembly of the heavenly hosts and the spirits of those who are near [to God] are gathered. There, the clouds of Divine Grace are lifted and at that moment, the believers rejoice in God’s joy. This is what is promised in the preserved tablets, in His mighty saying on the Day when “your Lord comes or some of His signs arrive.” This is what has been promised to everyone in the heavens and the earth, so that everyone will testify within themselves that this is the Truth, there is no god but He, and indeed He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-one-who-came-with-alis-shirt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-one-who-came-with-alis-shirt">The One Who Came with Ali’s Shirt</h3>
<p>18) Thus, know the station of the one who came with Ali’s shirt upon a cloud of light, and Muhammad, the Messenger of God, gave good tidings of meeting him on the day that the sincere ones rejoice. Then recognize, after he came to them with clear signs, what the fabricators said and what they did to him such that even the pen hesitates to record it. God bore witness to that even if you do not bear witness. They denied him and rejected him. Among them were those who said, “Has he fabricated this against God, or is he bewitching people with magic?” In this way, they veiled themselves from meeting God, did not respond to His command, and did not turn towards the direction toward which those who are near [to God] turn.</p>
<p>19) And you, O people of eloquence, be grateful to God for what He has generously given you, in that He has made Himself known to you and honored you with His meeting, and sent you forth with the truth. He has revealed to you that which suffices you beyond those who have disbelieved and associated others [with God], after everyone has been waiting for His days and have been promised thereof.</p>
<p>20) Thus, recognize what we have endowed you with, the truth, and honored you with grace. We have sheltered you on the shores of knowledge, taught you the paths of understanding, and drawn you near with the fire that has ignited the hearts of those who have believed and who constantly place their trust in their Lord, Allah.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-glass-vessels-of-possible-existence-were-illuminated" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-glass-vessels-of-possible-existence-were-illuminated">The Glass Vessels of Possible Existence Were Illuminated</h3>
<p>21) Then know that the purpose of the verse was nothing but what we have taught you in truth. However, only those who are patient in Allah will know it, and only the sincere will grasp it. This is from the grace that has not been preceded by the first and will not be surpassed by the last. Yet, you, O questioner, who hope for those days when the sun of care shone from the horizon of Oneness and the lamp of identity was lit in the niche of sanctity, will not witness this verse except in the structure that Allah has hidden behind the curtain of dignity, near the wing of His beloved. Do you not see how Allah ignited it for Himself with His own fire in the niche of eternity and safeguarded it with the lamp of power between the Earth and the sky, so that no breaths of associating partners with Allah would blow upon it? Light emerged from it behind seventy thousand veils to the extent of a needle’s eye, and from it, the glass vessels of possible existence were illuminated, each telling about Allah, their Creator, in what this divine fire has manifested to them. This is what we impart to you from the wonders of hidden knowledge, so you may thank your Lord Allah at all times, then all the believers, and be content with yourself for what has turned your heart towards the shore that no one of creation has ever reached, except those who are constantly consumed by the fire of love. And none shall approach it except those who have severed themselves from everyone in the realm of command and creation, and they tread the paths of submission by the permission of Allah.</p>
<p>22) Then we have sufficed with what we have explained to you in this holy verse and condensed in elucidating its meanings, because we have explained it before with various expressions and indications that bewilder the minds of those who know. Surely, be content with what has descended upon you on this blessed night, which Allah has made among the nights in which every decreed matter is determined, from an Almighty, Sustaining Lord. And if you are not content with what the pen of power has inscribed on those luminous tablets, return to what has been recorded before by the witnessed finger of glory, for in the Lote Tree of words, the fire of Oneness was kindled, and none shall draw from it except the monotheists. Upon its branches are doves, all created from the fire of love, and none shall hear their melodies except those who have detached themselves. By Allah, if you were to scrutinize with your sight, you would know all the sciences inscribed in these tablets and would be independent of anything else. Indeed, this is a known truth.</p>

<section id="about-the-disjointed-letters-in-the-scriptures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-disjointed-letters-in-the-scriptures">About the Disjointed Letters in the Scriptures</h2>
<p>23) As for what you asked about the disjointed letters in the scriptures and Psalms, know that each of these letters has verses for those who understand. Within them are symbols, indications, meanings, and implications that none comprehend except those who are in the good pleasure of Allah and are steeped in the satisfaction of knowledge. Their secrets have always been concealed in the treasures of infallibility, sealed with the seal of power, and veiled with the mask of glory. But then its seal is broken for your sake and your love, for what people are able to comprehend, so that those who have been guided by Allah before may bear witness that all of this was created in the temple of the one who speaks the truth, around whom circle all the elevated letters and comprehensive words, if you understand.</p>
<section id="point-to-eternal-beings-and-unifying-realties" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-to-eternal-beings-and-unifying-realties">Point to Eternal Beings and Unifying Realties</h3>
<p>24) Know that those disjointed letters, in the context of the Names, point to the eternal beings, the unifying realities, and the essence of existence, just as you read in the Qur’an where His exalted Light said at the beginning of the book: “Alif Lam Mim, This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous.” In this station, Allah named His beloved with these expanded, disjointed letters so that those who soar on the wings of detachment in the air of the spirit may be certain of this.</p>
<p>25) Indeed, O Muhammad, this “Book” refers to the book of your own self, and this is from the preserved Book of the Unseen, knowledge of which no one can encompass except Allah. From it are detailed all other books, if you only realize. This is from the Book in which is detailed the knowledge of what was and what will be, and by it are guided those who seek guidance. Everything that has been revealed before from books and scriptures is but a letter from that Book. And none understand this except those who ascend toward the proximity of the Divine on the steed of Glory. All of this is mentioned in the context of description, yet this hidden Book has a station beyond which all mention and all description by describers ceases. Everything that was and will be is created by His word “Be, and it is.”</p>
</section>
<section id="the-book-of-your-own-self" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-book-of-your-own-self">The Book of Your Own Self</h3>
<p>26) Thus, recognize the Book of the Self of Muhammad, in which all the secrets have been inscribed by the Pen of Allah, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Self-Sustaining, so you may bear witness that there is no god but He, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Beloved. In this way, it was revealed before to read the Book of your own Self. This is the Book that suffices those who believe and guides them to the shore of the stored Name. In another station, it refers to the Book that was revealed to him in truth, and Allah made it a criterion between those who believe and those who disbelieve and are unjust toward their Lord.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-most-beautiful-names" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-most-beautiful-names">The Most Beautiful Names</h3>
<p>27) In yet another station, know that when Allah named His Beloved with composite letters and all-encompassing words, just as you pronounce His names as Muhammad, Ahmad, and Mahmud in the realm of Names, He also named him with expansive letters and fragmented symbols so that anyone who has understanding thereafter would know that all the most sublime letters and the most beautiful names were created for Him, because nothing appears from the Beloved except what is intended by the Lover. This you would see if you looked with the vision of the spirit. To affirm what was stated, the verse of Eternity says: “To whomsoever you pray, His are the most beautiful Names.” This was revealed before, and you have read, and in his days, most people read.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="imprints-reflected-from-the-sun">Imprints Reflected from the Sun</h3>
<p>28) Then know that Allah created these expansive, fragmented letters in the name of His Beloved as essential expansiveness and subtle, elevated archetypes, just as you witness in the imprints reflected from the sun of Muhammadan light. Likewise, He created from the composite words in His name, structures that are limited and composed of elements of oneness, each according to the degree of their imprints from this sun. Therefore, ponder upon the creation of the heavens and the earth so that you understand every name in the shadow of His name, and every attribute in the shadow of His description, and be certain that everything is within the grasp of His power, created from letters. Be among those who peer into the manifestations of creation with the eye of Allah.</p>

<section id="three-stations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="three-stations">Three Stations</h3>
<p>29) In another station, the ‘Alif’ signifies the Absolute Divinity, and the ‘Lam’ indicates the Absolute Guardianship, which refers back to His self-sustaining essence, as stated: “Verily, your guardian is Allah.” This is from the guardianship of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The ‘Meem’ is about the Muhammadi reality and the Ahmadic pattern. Allah addressed him with these letters so that all may be certain that everything expressed in language, mentioned by the tongues of creation, or realized in the land of creation, all of that has appeared in the attire of Muhammadi essence. Likewise, this suffices you, if you listen.</p>
<p>30) By Allah, if I were to elaborate on these three stations in these three letters, neither tablets would suffice nor would ink ever run dry. However, it’s succinctly expressed in each station if you but know. The reins of the pen were not in my grasp, out of fear for those who have disbelieved and committed polytheism. If there was any resentment in their hearts for this youth who resides in the region of Iraq, and calls everyone to the Path, and has illuminated from the horizon of Oneness, lighting up all horizons. Thus, we mention some of the secrets of the matter, so that perhaps you may become enlightened. Otherwise, by He in Whose hand is the soul of Hussain, were I not restrained by the machinations of the hypocrites, I would write on the Tablet what would sever you from everyone in the heavens and the earth and elevate you to a station that neither ears have heard nor eyes have perceived. This everlasting bounty will never cease, even if it flows from the beginning which has no beginning to the end which none will witness, because the source of this Divine Spring and this Ocean of Oneness is nothing but the true bounty of the Lordly and the existential knowledge of the Eternal. How could this ever-running purity ever run out? By my Lord, it will neither run out nor vanish, and that is testified by what we have deduced as proof, and beyond that the inhabitants of the celestial realms also testify. Does the bounty of Allah ever end or His outpouring ever cease? By the Lord of the heavens and the earth, His mercy precedes all things and His bounty encompasses all existence.</p>

<section id="call-to-the-people" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="call-to-the-people">Call to the People</h3>
<p>31) Say, O people, this is from His bounty that descends upon you from the clouds of knowledge, rains of wisdom, and grants unto the contingent beings that which enters them into the pleasure of the Sacred and clothes them in the garment of eternity, if you ponder the secrets of this bounty.</p>
<p>32) Say, O people, how did you sleep on the bed and do not rise from the seats of heedlessness, after the sun of love has risen and all the disintegrated bodies are activated by its heat, yet you are like the cold mountain and do not melt from the radiance of this fire, even though everyone dwelling in the skirts of eternity is ignited by it.</p>
<p>33) Say, O people, if you do not hear from this servant who is certain of God, then in the ranks of love learn from this lamp. Learn how it is ignited by the fire of love and burns with the fire of its own self at all times. If you are in its burning, the beacons of remembrance, then listen. And he calls to God in his secret with the tongue embedded in him, saying: O my God and my Master, I ask You by Your lamp, which You have made sacred from the lamp, to send me into the presence of the lovers, in the station where the name of God, the Mighty, the Overseer, the Promised One who comes with the truth, is mentioned—upon shades of fire and around him angels of command circumambulate. When the clouds of sanctity are lifted and the leaves sing with a melody that attracts the hearts of those brought near.</p>
<p>34) Say, O people, hear my words, then recognize the value of those days and hold fast to the concealed golden thread. Do not be distracted by the world and its ornamentation. Let not adversity grieve you, nor be unsettled by what befalls you from those who disbelieve and associate partners with God, the Mighty, the Beloved. Be among the best of creation, those who are not hindered by any hindrance, not veiled by the blame of any blamer, and not deterred by the turning away of any turner. Even if all those on Earth were to stand against them—if you but knew—these are the ones who turn not their faces towards anyone and stand not still for anything in the domain. Even if they pass by cities of gold, like lightning they pass by without turning their gaze upon them. They are in the depths of detachment, engaged in glorification. These are they upon whom, when the signs of your Lord are recited, a fire of divine unity sparks in their hearts and their foundations tremble with yearning. Then they fall upon their faces in humble submission to God, the Sovereign, the Overseer, the Mighty, the Holy. All this is from the nature of those who are detached; we have conveyed it to you with truth, so perhaps you may hasten with your eyes toward the shore of grace.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-duration-of-concealment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-duration-of-concealment">The Duration of Concealment</h3>
<p>35) Then know that in another station, God intends by these letters the secrets of infinitudes, and among them is an allusion to the duration of the concealment of the Beauty behind the curtains of Majesty. Just as you witness in the traces of the Imams of Discrimination: “After the completion of the term with hardship, the Mahdi will rise.” Similarly, you are within all these letters and secrets; recognize until the time when lights will dawn from the dawn of the Holy Beloved.</p>
<p>36) Say, O leaders of eloquence, all of this is within the ranks of creation and origination, and the manifestations of bringing into existence and invention. So bear witness. Otherwise, in the stations which God has made a place for His Holy Manifestations, they will not point with a sign, nor will they narrate a story, nor will they indicate by indication. All are standing in the court of Holiness.</p>
<p>37) Say, O leaders of discernment, the letters have ascended to their positions and the words to their seats, and until then you are not aware. Have you not heard the day the caller calls, and have you not heard the outcry in truth? How are you until then, dead in the veils of your own selves? Rise from the beds of heedlessness, then ignorance and animosity, and then listen to the remembrance of God; that is better for you if you wish to return to the lands of nearness. Do you not contemplate past generations and what was decreed upon them when they opposed the Messengers of God and turned away from His Signs? After all, God has not sent a Messenger except that He has sent down with him a miracle that the mature are unable to perform, and every Messenger gave good news of a Messenger who would come after him, and all were promised with this.</p>
<p>38) Therefore, look at those who were given the Torah before Moses was sent to them. They were given good news from God, the Guardian, the Sustainer, of a Prophet who would come after. But when Moses came to them with the staff of command and the flame of love, they turned away from him and said, “This is nothing but a mad sorcerer.” They denied him, argued with him, and debated him until he spent a limited number of years. Then God elevated him by His command and brought him to the station that had been ordained for him, where he carried out His judgment, established His proof, and cut off the rear of those who disbelieved, associated others with God, and wronged without right. Just as today you pray for Moses and those who believed in him and curse Pharaoh and his troops. Thus, We recount to you from the stories of truth so that perhaps you will remember in the days of God.</p>
<p>39) Then Moses gave the people good tidings of the one who would come after him. But when Jesus came to them with manifest sanctified signs, they acted arrogantly towards him and said, “You are not that, you are nothing but a bewitched man.”</p>
<p>40) Similarly, Jesus informed them of a Prophet who would come after him with majestic signs. But when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, came to them, they turned away from him, denied him, and said, “This is nothing but a man who has fabricated things against God, the Guardian, the Sustainer.” Then, when he was raised to God, they gathered over his affair as you see today, and each lamented and beseeched based on what had happened to him, then cursed those who had wronged him.</p>
<p>41) Upon his ascension to the highest companion and his rising to the loftiest heights, he gave the people tidings of the one who would come after him. The entirety of the people of the Furqan were tied to this, the matter was decreed, and the duration passed until Ali came before Muhammad with clear signs, dazzling arguments, decisive evidences, and manifest proofs. Then everyone acted arrogantly against God in His affair, after all they had been promised of meeting him, witnessed by all that is inscribed in the Preserved Tablets. As you read in the Book, when God sealed prophethood with His beloved, He gave the servants good tidings of meeting him, and that was an inevitable event. So when God came in the shadows of the clouds, blew into the trumpet of the matter, the heavens split, and the mountains were leveled, then all turned on their heels and awaited his meeting, as do the Jews and Christians await what they had been promised before. From then until now, all are waiting, and how many messengers God has sent with truth after Moses until now, and they have not been perceived by the Jews. And in all years they say, he will come in another year, so know their measure and the measure of those who take shelter in the shade of their own selves.</p>
<p>42) Thus, look at these polytheists in what they did before and what they are to do today. We have detailed for you every piece of news and cast upon you what was decreed upon God’s messengers so that you may rise with the secrets of the matter and be among those who today enter under the shadow of the Face. And God has raised them to the station where He made them know Himself, after all they had been turning away from it.</p>
<p>43) Then let us return to what we were discussing and renew the garment of meanings over the structures of words, a sheer innovation woven so that you may be certain that the reins of affairs are in the grip of a capable, awe-inspiring Power, turning as He wills. When His decree comes upon everyone in the dominion, then all of them are turned. So know that if I mention the meanings of the ‘Alif’ which descended at the beginning of the book, as has been endowed in it a hidden pearl of knowledge, everyone in the heavens and the earth would be stunned—except those who are in the abyss on the Day of Power, facing the Divine Countenance, where they immerse themselves. They would gather over the dogs of the earth and seize me with the claws of hatred and deny the grace that descended from the elevated clouds in the name of God, and which quenches the thirst of those who are in the Faran of separation where the fire of separation burns. Some of them die as they are, such that even if the breath of life were blown into them, they would not love. Few of them drink from this fountain of life that flowed in the darkness of those words and praise God, their Creator, for what has dawned upon them from the other side of Iraq, enlightening the horizons after the spirits were stunned, then recovered.</p>
<p>44) Thus, know the dispersion of people in what they differ, and in that manner was revealed before to Muhammad, the Messenger of God, that few of His servants are grateful. But despite all this, when I did not want to disappoint the one who severed his ties for God, traveled to Him, and migrated for Him, I impart as much as the servants can bear, souls can endure, and minds can comprehend so that it serves as a reminder and good tidings from the servant to those who hasten to the Abode of Peace, under the shadow of the Tree of Connection, where they enter. So listen to what is revealed to you in this blessed spot about this eternal tree, from which fire does not blaze and no one gets close to it except those who orbit around it and offer themselves in His path, after His permission, and then with that, they give thanks.</p>
</section>
<section id="names-of-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="names-of-god">Names of God</h3>
<p>45) Know then that the ‘Alif’ stands as a sign for His Greatest Name, which is Allah, the ‘Lam’ for His concealed knowledge, and the ‘Meem’ for His name the Giver; meaning I am Allah, the Most Knowledgeable, the Giver. These are names with which God has specified Himself in the beginning of His book, and with that He intended what He intended. No one will know how He intended because no one precedes Him in His knowledge, and we are all certain and acknowledging of this.</p>
</section>
<section id="positions-of-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positions-of-god">Positions of God</h3>
<p>46) Then, in the position God the Exalted intended for the ‘Alif,’ it signifies His Oneness in Essence, and from the ‘Lam,’ the guardianship of His protector, for the ‘Lam’ is the letter of guardianship if you but knew, and from the ‘Meem,’ the prophethood of His beloved, for it is the letter of prophethood as manifested in the first name of His messenger, as you all witness. The letter of guardianship is presented before the letter of prophethood, bearing witness those with heart that this is a good tidings for everyone in the heavens and the earth that the one who comes after Muhammad will prioritize in His great name the name of guardianship over the name of prophethood, as you know in Ali before Muhammad. This is indicated by the second verse of Al-Furqan as revealed in truth: “This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah, who believe in the unseen.” And the unseen in the era of Muhammad was none other than Ali, before his noble self, if you but believe in this unseen. And with this unseen, God took the covenant in the seed of distinction from everyone in the heavens and the earth, but most people do not understand.</p>
<p>47) So understand how the rooster of the throne crows and sings in the flapping of eternity, teaching you what your minds find peace with, your souls find rest in, and your hearts find glad tidings from, and monotheists rejoice because of it. Then recognize the greatness of this matter such that God mentioned it at the beginning of His book and His first address with His beloved. Yet despite all that, these transgressors have broken God’s covenant, violated His pact, denied His proof, and they were not satisfied with all that; they did what would break the patience of the patient ones. Thus, we impart to you some of the secrets of the matter if you but listen with the ears of sanctity.</p>
<p>48) By Allah, if you contemplate the “Lam” that descended between the two sanctuaries, you would certainly reach everything you seek. For the “Lam” in its form is three, just as those who delve into its numerical value consider it to become three by itself—the “Lam,” the “Alif,” and the “Meem.” Thus, everything we have been asked about is contained in it. For the “Meem” has manifested from itself, which indicates its self-sufficiency if you are flying in the atmosphere of abstraction and the space of monotheism. From this, those who draw inferences infer that there is no god but He; He is One in His essence, One in His attributes, One in His name, and One in His action. Is there any god other than Him? Say: Glory be to Allah! There is no god but He, and we are all unto Him, and all are perplexed in His action. By this, the veils of polytheism are burned, the indicators of limitation fade away, and the banners of the monotheists are raised.</p>

<section id="alif-is-a-medium-between-lam-and-meem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alif-is-a-medium-between-lam-and-meem">Alif is a Medium Between Lam and Meem</h3>
<p>49) Then contemplate the “Alif,” which God made a medium between the “Lam” and the “Meem.” This is something that is not known by perception nor understood by knowledge, even if everyone in the heavens pondered since the pre-eternity. When the doors of meanings are closed in this solid letter, open the doors of expressions to what you are capable of, if you but listen.</p>
<p>50) Then know that if you rotate this divine “Alif” around itself, two standing “Alifs” appear. Afterward, if you elevate them to the tens, the number twenty appears. When this occurs, it forms the structures of monotheism, manifestations of uniqueness, and locations of abstraction, and that happens before its coupling with the cornerstone of “Nun,” if you but understand. After its coupling, symbolic indications are created in the realms of specification and royal signs in the realms of composition. By this, those endowed with knowledge bear witness to the secrets of wisdom from what has been transpired by the pen of the Glorious Witness.</p>
<p>51) Then know that all letters and words revert back to this solid “Alif” and this demonstrative number, if you bear witness with the vision of the heart. Indeed, it is the manifestation of letters without pointing to it. Likewise, knowledge descends from Him truthfully, if you can comprehend, if you understand. Otherwise, ask Allah, your Lord, to teach you of His knowledge and grant you what will suffice you from those who do not follow the signs of Allah and walk in enveloping darkness, covered by the waves of fire from all directions, submerged in it, yet unaware.</p>
</section>
<section id="all-letters-are-manifestations-of-alif" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="all-letters-are-manifestations-of-alif">All Letters are Manifestations of Alif</h3>
<p>52) Then consider the secrets deposited in this “Alif,” wherein in all the letters are manifestations of this “Alif.” For example, witness in this “Alif” the letter “Ba,” in its submission. Its Creator was bent over the earth in its entirety, humbling Himself before Allah, as you bear witness to its form. Then it appears on the structure of “Dal,” bowing in the presence of Allah, the Guardian, the Beloved. And when it prostrates to Allah, the essence of the letter “Sad” appears, and from it flows the water by which Allah gives life to all in the heavens and the earth in stages of creation, if you ponder upon the signs of creation. Similarly, know all the letters, and all of them appear on different structures as they are manifested by this “Alif,” as you see in the alphabetic letters. And when Allah wishes to manifest this “Alif,” a radiance shines upon them, in His likeness, as they all appear in the forms of these letters. If they would rid themselves of these limited symbols, then they all are in the structure of this “Alif,” and in its form they are sent forth. And if you wish to witness the standing manifestations of this “Alif” in the letters, in its form and standing, you will be convinced within yourself that it stands above all things.</p>
<p>53) Then look into the numbers, as you witness in the geometry counts, for example, this “Alif.” If you immerse it in the oceans of the tens, the “Alif” appears in its form by the visitation of the dot, and from it emerges the “Ya,” for its number is ten, as you count in arithmetic. Likewise, if it ascends to the heaven of hundreds, the “Alif” itself appears with the addition of two dots, then you have the letter “Qaf” at that moment. So, look, and so it ascends until it reaches the end of the numbers, then the letter “Alif” appears in the rank of the fourth with the addition of dots, and the number one thousand appears, and with that you have the letter “Ghain,” so bear witness.</p>
<p>54) Therefore, bear witness to how the traces of Oneness run in the domain of letters; you witness in the horizons of possibilities and the selves of the intellects that there is no god but He, and to Him, all return. When this “Alif” witnessed itself in the first and last of the letters, it testified within itself, in the tongue of its secret, that it is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and with all that, they affirm the Oneness of their Creator, and before Him, they prostrate. In that station, all the letters confirm this “Alif,” and likewise, this “Alif” manifests itself upon the letters, if you are searching in the satisfaction of Oneness. At the time when the “Alif” becomes, the letter “Ba” confirms it, and so do you in the opposite way, so bear witness.</p>
<p>55) Then know that the dots added to it in all its stations and ranks indicate the symbols that it takes on in the descents of its manifestations, so that people can enumerate them according to their capacity and what they are capable of. Otherwise, if it were in its station and did not wear the garment of limits, the hearts of those with insight would not comprehend it, nor would the intellectuals understand it.</p>
<p>56) Therefore, witness the manifestation of this “Alif” within yourself, that you are at a moment where you hear and see, you speak what you wish, such that nothing prevents you from one thing to another, nor does any action block you from another action, as you all witness that within yourselves.</p>
<p>57) Likewise, witness in the names, at a time when the name “The All-Hearing” confirms you, so too does the name “The All-Seeing” confirm you, as well as other names, if you look with clear eyes within yourselves. And all that is in attributes to which all people, until then, attribute them to their Creator without realizing it.</p>
</section>
<section id="strive-to-enter-these-stations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strive-to-enter-these-stations">Strive to Enter These Stations</h3>
<p>58) Therefore, witness within yourself that all of this is created in His dominion and He bestows it upon whom He wills among His servants. Indeed, there is no deity except Him; He is not comprehended by all that you comprehend nor is He known by what you know. Rather, He created these stations within the selves of His servants so that all may deduce from that that He created the names and is sanctified from them, and made the attributes and is exalted from them. Indeed, there is no creator but He; to Him belongs command and creation, and all are created by His command. Therefore, say, “Exalted is Allah, the Sovereign, the Sustainer. Exalted is Allah, the Capable, the Creator, the Empowered, the Mighty, the Beloved.” But O people of articulation, strive with your spirits and yourselves to enter this station, and do not be among those upon whom no name among the names confirms them, nor are they characterized by these attributes. And do not be among those who have eyes but do not see, ears but do not hear, and hearts but do not understand.</p>
<p>59) Then witness within yourself that you stand, sleep, and walk by one thing, and this is a known truth. Nevertheless, different names and numerous attributes manifest from you, as you all observe and acknowledge within yourselves. These various names and numerous attributes appear according to what is decreed in your souls and created in your bodies. Perhaps you will ascend to the heights of understanding within yourselves. For instance, what you do is one, whether you call it by all the names or remember it. Yet, He is in His essence devoid of everything you say or to which you allude within yourselves. However, when directed towards the location of hearing and its causes, an effect, a quality, and a name appear that would not appear otherwise. Similarly, when directed towards the location of sight and its preordained causes, another effect and quality appear. This is what you find within yourselves. Similarly, in the tongue, when directed towards it, speech appears as you speak. This is due to His orientation to the external causes within the human structure. Similarly, in the inner, with the inner sight—witness, for example, when attached to the heart, liver, spleen, head, and others, different names appear in these varying stations, as you term with the mind, soul, and heart.</p>
<p>60) Therefore, understand the manifestation of this ‘Alif’ within yourself, even though it is one. See how God has brought forth from it varying names and differing effects, so that you may attain the station of inner knowledge. Witness that diversity appears due to the variation of place and causes; otherwise, the One who manifests is one, and the manifestation is one. All this is within yourselves; do you not then perceive? And you should be certain that there is no god but He, who has created all beings collectively with all His names and attributes. If you observe the marvels of creation within yourselves, you will not go astray. All of this is created within His dominion and appears in the station of creation.</p>
<p>61) And you, O people of eloquence, do not transgress your bounds. Be cautious concerning God and do not attribute to yourselves what you have not been endowed with. Then, do not exalt yourselves above your station. We have clarified for you what has bewildered the hearts of the gnostics, wise, and scholars in the insinuations of these words so that you may glimpse what they contain and drink from it, each according to their capacity and station, and what they are capable of, like everyone in the heavens and the earth from this flowing fountain.</p>
<p>62) Therefore, recognize this spiritual ‘Alif,’ this eternal pattern, and this singular, straight thread as one who stands by himself for himself, facing the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. At one moment, he raises his head toward the sky and the hearts of the celestial beings are drawn to him; at another moment, he turns to the Earth, and the bodies of the chosen ones rise from the graves of annihilation. In the same way, We cast upon you what has been etched by the Finger of Power upon the preserved tablets of sanctity.</p>

<section id="the-alif-is-a-model-in-all-worlds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-alif-is-a-model-in-all-worlds">The Alif is a Model in All Worlds</h3>
<p>63) Then know that this upright, firmly established ‘Alif’ is a model in all worlds, and all who are under the thread of His providence derive from it. Everything you witness in all that has been and will be created—whether it’s uprightness, stability, strength, or power—know that it all emanates from the uprightness of this Divine ‘Alif.’ All are sheltered under the shadow of this ‘Alif,’ and by its uprightness, they are upright. By God, the discourse has reached a point where the signs of knowledge and the indications of wisdom cease, so that you may give thanks to God, your Lord, in your days and be among those who have turned away from all on Earth and face toward the Beauty of the One, in garments of light, beyond veils. They drink the wine of meanings and life from the hands of Spirit, continually drinking.</p>
<p>64) Even if all foods were presented to them and all beauties revealed, they would not care. Even if they were approached with gold bracelets and garments of honor made of silk and brocade, they would not be swayed or turn toward them. Even if they were faced with all that Earth offers of gold and silver and all the ornaments of the kingdom, they would neither care for it nor turn toward it. These are the friends of God; there is no fear upon them, nor do they grieve. They fear no one, even if everyone in the heavens and the Earth stood against them; they feel no loneliness, because their hearts, souls, and minds are filled with the wine of God’s mercy and His love. There is not an opening in their hearts for the love of anything else to enter.</p>
<p>65) Thus, we acquaint you with the sincere, that perhaps you may recognize and follow their way, in such a state that neither the storms of the kingdom shake you, nor the tempests of time cause your feet to slip. May you be among those who are firmly rooted in the love of God.</p>

<section id="contains-secrets-from-all-sciences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contains-secrets-from-all-sciences">Contains Secrets from All Sciences</h3>
<p>66) Then know that this ‘Alif’ contains secrets from all sciences due to the unique favor God has bestowed upon it. In it is the measure of knowledge of what was and what will be. For example, if you were to extract the letters that reside in the mysteries of this ‘Alif,’ just as we previously imparted to you concerning the stations of the Four, and write them down and then divide them into four categories, proceeding with each category according to its requisites for ascent, descent, elevation, and equilibrium, the secrets that confound minds will be revealed to you. You will learn what you have heard from the comprehensive numerical calculations and reach the origin of the sciences.</p>
<p>67) Oh, how we wish we could find someone who understands what we intend, so that we could impart to him what God has taught us of His favor. However, since we have found you, we have imparted to you according to what is possible and suffice with that, lest every rejected tyrant gains access to it.</p>
<section id="serve-as-symbols-between-the-lover-and-beloved" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="serve-as-symbols-between-the-lover-and-beloved">Serve As Symbols Between the Lover and Beloved</h4>
<p>68) Then know that these disjointed letters exist in a station where they serve as symbols between the lover and the beloved, the devotee and the object of devotion. No one becomes privy to this except those whose hearts God has made the repositories of His knowledge and treasuries of His wisdom. This is what is preordained by the knowledge of God, the Overseer, the Beloved.</p>
<p>69) Then know that this Alif (Arabic letter) in its station points to the white earth and the green, lustrous light, if you seek to explore the secrets of natural creation. The clarity and color of this earth are from water, if you understand. And when the water solidifies—exalted be God, its Creator, and transcendent is He beyond what you describe—when this lustrous water solidifies within this fiery water and takes heat from this golden, fiery water, the three elements: spirit, soul, and body, unite within it. This is something that no one’s knowledge has preceded in understanding, and all are bewildered by it.</p>
<p>70) When this earth, formed from water, solidifies in this red water, it emerges with the soot of fire on its surface, meaning it turns black. Do not grieve, for if it darkens, there is no harm, because God will replace this darkness with light so that it may ignite and illuminate by the permission of God, the Overseer, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>71) This is the fruit of sanctity that has appeared from the tree that grew in the heavens of celestial spheres and the earth of intellects. This is the philosopher’s stone, their elixir, the earth of the thirsty, their mercury, and all that they name. If you extract it from the Divine ore, assign to it the spirit that was of it and closely related to it, for a body does not accept a foreign spirit, if you safeguard what we convey to you. No days pass except that it whitens by the permission of God. Therefore, strive in purifying it so that nothing remains in it of the darkness in which there is corruption, to the utmost of what you can attain.</p>
<p>72) Then after that, dry it with suitable fire and assign to it this spirit once more. Then ignite upon it sugarcane fire until above this water is lifted stored grape oil. By God, this is the gold of the wise in which souls are lost and the intellects of the wise are bewildered. Until now, the servants who are not distracted by the adornments of this world from the remembrance of God, the Overseer, the Self-Sustaining, have not reached it. This is the soul, the blood, and the red sap, and it revives the desiccated bodies if blown into them from this spirit.</p>
<p>73) Therefore, you, the assembly of craftsmen, seek. But adjust the fire and do not apply it to it to the extent that harms it, for fire both corrupts and rectifies, if you perceive. This is from fire, gold, the soul, sulfuric water, divine water, and aerial water; it is called by all names and attributes at its stages and levels, depending on what colors and actions appear in it.</p>
<p>74) Thus, we instruct you so that all may be certain that this Iraqi soul possesses sciences that the ancients have not preceded in, and the later people will not know. Perhaps by that, they may become aware within themselves and not presume what they today presume. And if, my brother, this luminous child and this spiritual infant appear to you on the face of the water, unveil it little by little until your matter is complete.</p>

<section id="resurrection-of-the-bodies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resurrection-of-the-bodies">Resurrection of the Bodies</h4>
<p>75) By God, if it is affected by the heat of the fire, it snatches away sight. Exalted be the Maker, the Creator, the Capable, the Planner, the Mighty, the Feared. This is from the essence of the spirit and its reality. If it is applied to anything else, it is metaphorically applied. With it, the dead bodies are revived, and they rise from their graves, and in the land of planning, they are gathered. When the resurrection of the bodies appears to you on the day when the trumpet is blown, in it the garment of creation is renewed, and all are present in the sanctified assembly with their deeds, and are recompensed for what they have done in the vain life and are given in full what they would find.</p>
<p>76) Then the melodies of the scrolls are renewed, and every being in the heavens and the earth is changed, and the land of knowledge is spread out, and the rooster of divine unity crowed. Then, the believers ride on the steeds of light. If we were to mention to you all that appears on this day, the tablets would not carry it, and the souls would be disturbed by it. Therefore, we fold its mention and return to what we mentioned before so that the favor from God may precede those who are in the garment of existence.</p>
<p>77) Then know that if you marry this oil that we have revealed to you in truth with this earth, you will reach what you desire quicker than your sight returns to you if you are fortunate in this work. Thus, recognize gold and silver, then the sun and the moon, then the white and red gum, perhaps you will understand. In this regard, they have said that the work was only from the greatest of the enlightened ones, as you bear witness in the books of the people. Likewise, recognize what they say that our gold is not the gold of the masses, and the same goes for silver if you understand.</p>
<p>78) This is what is named “the two-winged one,” and it was a bird in all bodies and is given all the names. For example, it is called water due to its flowing and running, and it is called fire because it is hot in its nature, and likewise, the earth due to its internal dryness in it, and likewise, the air for the gathering of what is gathered in it. All this is witnessed by whoever delved into the secrets of nature and was among those who are cut off from anything other than God and turn towards Him, and thus they reach that highest station.</p>
<p>79) Then know that this radiant, fiery oil is the crown of all crowns, the divine crown, and the crown of triumph, for by it all bodies are transformed. That is, by it, all bodies are purified from corrupting sticky humors and from harmful, shadowy dryness. Through it, everything created on earth is healed from all diseases. Indeed, it is the essence of the agent by which the world stands. It is the heat without which there would be no movement, and movement comes from the action that arises from it. Likewise, know that all knowledge is from heat if you ponder upon the essences of the knowledge of reality.</p>
<p>80) It is the journey of the brave, the remembrance of the young, the shining mercury, and the spirit that is blown upon the dry bones to bring them to life and to rise by the permission of God, the Sovereign, the All-Powerful, the Sustainer.</p>
<p>81) Then know that the spirit is none other than the frozen water on the surface of the white earth. This is from the matter that suddenly appears from it, like quick inspiration. God has made it dominant over everything, for it took refuge before all things in the shadow of the name of God, the Dominant, the Capable. You witness from it the signs of capability if you reach this station. This white earth is the stone from which rivers burst forth. It is singular in its kind, and its governance is also singular. If you witness in this singularity the multiplications of the Four, you bear witness to its example of the Aleph that we were mentioning. This Aleph is singular in itself, and it is not a number but rather from it numbers are derived and multiplicities are extracted.</p>
<p>82) Yet you, in the multiplicities of the worlds of numbers, perceive the rise of the One. This is the stone in which the three kinds are gathered, and you witness with your eyes if you ponder in it with the knowledge of God. It speaks of the Night of Destiny, for in it is a predetermined concealed knowledge that God has hidden from the hearts of His servants, just as He has hidden the Night of Destiny from those who do not look with God’s sight at the realities of things. We likened it to the night because, after the governance of the First, blackness and darkness appear in it. These are from the darknesses in which is predetermined the water of life.</p>
<p>83) This is from the truth of what you have not heard before. So, if you are, O assembly of eloquence, then listen.</p>
<p>84) Then ponder what was previously revealed in the Criterion (Al-Furqan) regarding the judgment of the three darknesses so that your eyes may be satisfied, and you reach the ultimate aim that people have strived for. Verily, you, O servant, know that when the Green of Splendor reached the east of everlastingness at the fountain of this water, he neither turned towards it nor drank from it. The spirit shifted him from himself towards the right of the mighty Beloved, for this youth did not desire the perpetuity of his self in the dominion but spent his spirit and what he has over everyone in the heavens and the earth. This is what he chose for himself out of love for God, the Sovereign, the Dominant, the Capable, the Praised.</p>
<p>85) Say, O people, by God, this servant did not desire anything for himself nor sought assistance against anyone in the dominion except from God alone. This is what the tongue of Oneness testifies to in the tent of concealed unseen. Say, verily this lamp did not seek the niche, nor is it influenced by fire, and it does not illuminate from anything except from God, the Single, the Mighty, the Exalted, the Sustainer. Then thank God, your Creator, for what He has unveiled to you of secrets through this bejeweled, delimited pen. Even if it is limited by its boundaries, yet from it God has flowed what has neither boundaries nor an end. These are the secrets of Singularity in this delimitation, so bear witness. This is from the knowledge that God taught my pen so that all may be certain that the heavens of knowledge are folded by His right and the earth of wisdom is made by His permission, and all inquire from the wonders of His knowledge.</p>

<section id="creation-of-balanced-temperaments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creation-of-balanced-temperaments">Creation of Balanced Temperaments</h4>
<p>86) Then know that the first thing that occurred from the Ancient Originator in the worlds of creation are the four elements: fire, air, water, and earth, as you have heard before. Then you hear when the four temperaments appear, which are heat, moisture, cold, and dryness, as you enumerate and know. When they mixed and married, two corners appeared for each one: for fire, it’s heat and dryness, and likewise for the remaining three, you know this through these principles. By them, God created all that is in the worlds of creation, from the higher realms to the lower. Whatever has balanced temperaments remains over time, as you witness in the sun and the moon. And whatever does not have balanced temperaments will perish soon, as you observe in the creation of the lower worlds.</p>
<p>87) Then strive to know the balanced things among the metals, for they are easier to manage in work if you are successful with them. For the matter is nothing but detailing, purifying, and marrying. This is from the truth that all prophets speak of. If you know the essence of nature from the divine metal, take from it according to your need, then distill it with the water of the Living, which is in its temperament and is the closest thing to it, until this essence becomes pure white. Then subject it to water, place it in dew until it dissolves from this essence as much as possible. If this earth dissolves this spirit, then afterward place it in blindness until it mixes and becomes one thing. Then subject it to gentle fire. If you do that once or more, in both the tying and the dissolving, it is closer to the truth, if you do so. If you can’t, subject this water to this earth, then put it in dissolution until this water becomes pure white. Then wax this earth with this water to reach the end you desire. Then dissolve it after waxing because the end of waxing was the first station of dissolution. Then after dissolution, you tie. Then the work of the moon is completed, and you witness the power of God with your own eyes, if you learn what we have established in this tablet. Then after that, you work because knowledge is before action. Beware, then beware, O eloquent ones, before your knowledge of all that we have taught you, do not commence. This is my advice to you; listen to it if you desire to follow the paths of truth.</p>
<p>88) Then know that the essence can be referred to this water, for water is the origin in operations. From it comes the pure oil, with which if you anoint, will never burn. This is from the water by which God revives the earth after its death and manifests the judgment of resurrection. Some of the wise prophets were content with this water for this work and achieved what they aimed for from the ultimate goal. This is from the sealed knowledge of truth, known by those whose hearts God has tested with faith, and God taught them from mercury alone. This treasure was the seal of God for the sealed. If you wish to work with gold in the Sun, then revert to this body of pure oil that we have taught you before and we named it the gold of the people and the sulfur of the Living, if you are confused in its act.</p>
<p>89) By God, we have mentioned to you all the operations and cast upon you what no one before you could grasp in knowledge, and you bear witness with your souls and selves to that, if you know. We have mentioned to you in a hint of indications the balance of nature, which if anyone gets hold of, they would have achieved the ultimate goal in this Divine wisdom and this Divine gift, if you understand. Then we will cast upon you what will suffice you from those who are busy with this craft on Earth. Know that if you realize that the matter is nothing but from mercury and sulfur, and then you know them in the sun and the moon, which are gold and silver, then know that salt is beneficial in decomposing bodies to the extent that you will not find better than it for gold if you examine all things.</p>
<p>90) Because in its very nature is a complete suitability that can’t be completed by the pen, even if you write for the entire duration of your life. Indeed, if you find this salt from its ore and distill it and decode with it every secret that was from it and is generated from it until it becomes one soul and stable oil, by God, you will reach the peak of knowledge and the known. For in salts is the secret of secrets of hidden truth, like the ultimate sciences that were in the hearts of the pure. Do you not bear witness? This is from the right of certainty that all people are lost from, wandering in the valley of ignorance. So does the leaves of knowledge suffice on the branches of wisdom with the tunes of the attraction of a beloved, and we are content with that.</p>
<p>91) I fear in what we have revealed to you the matter by holy indicative signs, but no one will attain that except by the love of God and His allies. This is what advises you with this supreme pen in these numbered tablets. But if you listen to me, then seek from God what will suffice you from gold and silver. By God, this is the end of the matter if you listen, for gold and silver will not suffice anyone but increases them in poverty, as you bear witness. But with what we have called you with, it will suffice you from everyone in the heavens and the earth, if you hold on to the thread of the matter in this saying.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="this-alif-descended-at-the-beginning-of-the-criterion">This Alif Descended At the Beginning of the Criterion</h3>
<p>92) Then know that this ‘Alif’ descended at the beginning of the Criterion, and indeed we have explained it to you through signs that bewilder minds. It is created from the ‘Alif’ that descended in the proclamation from God, the High, the Guardian, the Self-Subsistent. Rather, it is nonexistent to Him if you ponder upon its secrets and in the station where His essence and Himself exist, if you enter into the pavilion of Unity. Therefore, recognize the standing, upright ‘Alif’ on the day when the essences of knowledge will be sent forth in the point of promised sanctity. Then will come the one whom God will manifest on the clouds of knowledge and power, and on his right are the angels of the command. Then everyone on Earth will be stunned by the thunderbolt of the day. The pillars of creation will shake, and everyone from the authority of God’s command will be disturbed.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blessed-are-those-who-attain-his-beauty">Blessed Are Those Who Attain His Beauty</h3>
<p>93) Blessed are those who attain His beauty, and then they will enter the paradise of sanctity before Him. Then, when they decide on something, they will not say ‘why’ or ‘how,’ but will hasten in what they are commanded. They will not fear from the assembly of proclamation and are like infants running to the breast of God’s mercy. They will not be distracted by anything and will not fear anyone. Even if all those in the proclamation or other religions were to prevent them, they would neither be prevented nor be distracted by anything, and they would not open their eyes to anyone, because they are looking solely at the essence of beauty.</p>
<p>94) Thus, we ask God to make us and you among those who are encircling Him, present in His court, and witnessing before Him, for indeed He is the Capable, the Giver, the Mighty, the Beloved.</p>
