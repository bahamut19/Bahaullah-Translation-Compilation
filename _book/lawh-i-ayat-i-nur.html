<section id="the-letters-were-created" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-letters-were-created">The Letters Were Created</h2>
<p>1) Praise be to God who created the letters in the worlds of obscurity, behind the veils of sanctity, in the heights of the Most Exalted. He then nourished them from the chalices of perpetuity, as He had ordained in the Tablets of Decree, to revive the hearts of those drawn near in the realm of execution. He then clothed them with the garment of blackness, according to His eternal predestination, in the hidden recesses of destiny, upon the crimson domes, surpassing all prior knowledge, so as to conceal the water of life in the darkness of the realms of names at the Lote Tree of the Limit. Then He sent them down to the realm of creation in the air of destiny.</p>
<section id="the-dot-was-manifested-after-140000-years" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dot-was-manifested-after-140000-years">The Dot Was Manifested After 140,000 Years</h3>
<p>2) Then the voice emerged from the Most High abode, addressing the First Pen, saying, “O Pen, write from the secrets of the Ancient onto the luminous white tablet.” Upon hearing this call, the Pen swooned in yearning for seventy thousand years beyond what the counters could count. When it revived, as determined by the divine decree, it wept for another seventy thousand years with tears of crimson. Then it stood before God in a time that was preceded by the ruling of the Primordial Beginning and is not followed by the ruling of the Ultimate End. When it was burned by the fire of separation after the sweet call ceased, its tears took on the color of blackness in the realm of fidelity. A drop of these black tears fell onto the tablet. Then appeared the dot in the world of origination. This dot manifested itself with the embroidery of the Primordial in the mirrors of the letters within the realities of the names.</p>
<p>3) Then the Alif received it before all other letters in the scattering of things and detailed this divine dot in the embroidery of this eternal Alif, as the breezes of the Merciful blew upon it from the source of Oneness. Then the face of unity was unveiled behind the green veils, and the structure of the dot appeared in the form of Alif and stood on the tablet as it stood upon the command of the Most High God in the world of attributes and names. This is the station where the essence of Will wore the robe of Nomenclature and shed the attire of Qualities in the city of Grandeur.</p>
<p>4) When this standing Alif settled on the luminous tablet, it manifested in a manifestation of other innovations. Then the disconnected letters appeared at the beginning of manifestations to indicate the worlds of individuation and the command in the stalks of creation. Then, from these letters that appeared and shone from the primal Alif at the beginning of manifestations, emerged the worlds of determination and multiplicities. When they detailed, dispersed, and fragmented, then gathered, harmonized, mixed, and combined, then appeared the compound words and composite letters in the worlds of creation, in the structures of names and attributes.</p>
<p>5) Thus, the worlds of sovereignty were completed, and the mysteries of power were established in the manifestations of existents, so that all may indicate through the language of beings that He is the everlasting, the permanent, the Creator, the capable, the mighty, the Sultan. And that ’Ali, before Muhammad, is the Manifestation of the Essence and the Manifestation of Attributes, from whom originated the possible beings, and to whom all creatures return. He is the one who, from his own self, the munificent, the soul of Rahman, created jewels and capabilities in the world of possibility, and manifestations of existents in the worlds of time and space. The mirrors reflecting Him, and the letters speaking from Him, are the first creation of God, the beginning of manifestations, and the return of servants on the Day of Calling. This is what God has favored them over the rest of creation in the worlds of eternity.</p>
<p>6) Through them, the lights have shone, the moons have appeared, the suns have illuminated, and the stars have been revealed. All speak about Him and point to Him, such that there is no difference between Him and them except that they were created by His command, sent by His will, and gathered by His power. They are the ones through whom cycles turn, spheres revolve, the trees of monotheism are planted, the fruits of individuation appear, and the rains of abstraction descend, until the point returns to its original position after its orbit around itself and reaching its place. Then, the end returns to the beginning, and at that moment, the call of the first appears from the Ultimate Tree when the sun rises once again.</p>
<p>7) This is what the leaves have sung at the axis of perpetuity on this night of oneness, in which the fire of unity is kindled from the Tree of Sinai under the shade of the name of the Primordial and the eternal secret named as the Ancient Truth in the Preserver of names. All manifestations bear witness in the secrets of the heart to the hidden, that He is the Mighty, the Able, the Dominant, the Beneficent.</p>

<section id="the-purpose-of-this-book" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-purpose-of-this-book">The Purpose of This Book</h2>
<p>8) This is a book from the “B” before the “H” to those who have believed in God and have succeeded by the lights of guidance, to bring them to the pavilion of sanctity and draw them near to the destination which none among those who disbelieved in God have reached. The structures of the names in the cities of the attributes bear witness to this, and beyond them, the angels of sanctity also testify.</p>
<p>9) Say, indeed in the singing of the leaves on the branches, and the phases of the leaves of paradise, and the undulation of the sea of oneness, and the rising of the clouds of wisdom, and the falling of the rains, and the flowing of the rivers from the stones, and the establishment of the structure of eternity upon the throne of lights are signs for those who look through the sight of God upon the realities of things. Reflect, O assembly of loved ones, on the creation of the heavens and the earth, and then on your own selves, if you are guided in the manifestations of power by the lights of guidance in the days of the face.</p>
<section id="about-secrets-none-have-preceded-in-knowing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-secrets-none-have-preceded-in-knowing">About Secrets None Have Preceded in Knowing</h3>
<p>10) And a book has come before us from the letter “Qaf,” which traveled from itself and migrated to God, the Overseer, the Sustainer, reaching the sanctified places and entering the Egypt of certainty, in the station where God’s fire blazes behind veils of light and where the lamp of oneness is ignited in a scripted lantern. Thus, they have preceded those who migrated from their homes for the love of God, over those who have not turned towards the shore of sanctity in the city that is circled by those who are near. He asked in his book about secrets that none have preceded in knowing in the realm, and whose veil has never been lifted from the face of any of the creation, and that the knowledgeable have not grasped. Therefore, listen to what calls you from the caller of the spirit in this blessed spot, beyond the whirlpool of the spirit, in the raging sea set in writing.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="about-the-verse-of-light" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-verse-of-light">About the Verse of Light</h2>
<p>11) Then know that what you asked about the verse of light that was revealed to Muhammad, the Messenger of God, before this verse, is beyond the grasp of scholars. Even if all the pens in God’s knowledge were used, and all the ink of destiny were exhausted to write what has been and what will be, the meanings of the letter that descended through the tongue of glory in this blessed revealed verse would not be depleted. However, I will drip upon you a droplet from the sea of knowledge and wisdom, so you may be among those who hasten to the fields of knowledge, and drink from the cups of care from the hands of the youth upon the couches of eternity.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Surah an-Nur (24:35) Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as it were a shining star. (This lamp is) kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself) though no fire touched it. Light upon light. Allah guideth unto His light whom He will. And Allah speaketh to mankind in allegories, for Allah is Knower of all things.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<section id="moses-guided-by-the-fire-from-the-tree-of-eternity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moses-guided-by-the-fire-from-the-tree-of-eternity">Moses Guided By the Fire From the Tree of Eternity</h3>
<p>12) When Moses completed the appointed term in the land of Midian, he returned with his family and entered the wilderness of Sinai, in the valley of sanctity, to the right of the garden of Paradise, on the shore of eternity. There he heard the call from the highest abode, across the void, saying, “O Moses, look what you see; indeed, I am God, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob.” Moses then covered his face out of fear of God, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Self-Sustaining. He was called again near the shore of the sea of majesty, under the crimson dome, “Raise, O Moses, your head.” When he raised it, he saw a light ignited and shining from the ultimate tree in the green valley. Then he was guided by the supreme guidance from the fire kindled from the tree of eternity. He then took off the sandals of desire and detached himself from the dominion of the Hereafter and this world. All of this was ordained by God, as you read in the tablets. Thus, his rank was elevated, his remembrance exalted, and he became among those who direct themselves by the lights of the fire toward the paths of justice. This is what was decreed for Moses, son of Imran, under the dome of time, if you indeed know.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-fire-blazed-within-muhammads-chest" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fire-blazed-within-muhammads-chest">The Fire Blazed Within Muhammad’s Chest</h3>
<p>13) Likewise, Faran of love bore witness near Faran of fire, in the sanctified Horeb and the proximity of Sinai, if you, in the scrolls of justice, with the eye of God, bear witness. So when the veils of Oneness were lifted and the lights of Unity shone in the rise of the Muhammadan light, the fire of Being was ignited for himself, in himself, by himself, and the fire of the tree blazed within his chest. Then, the tinges of love and pulls of longing took him from every direction, and he heard the call of God from the tree of Man in his secret, stating that you are God, the Sovereign, the Overseer, the Mighty, the Holy. This was decreed in the wilderness of the Spirit for Muhammad, in the station to which no hearts of those before could ever approach. Thus, we recount to you from the secrets of knowledge and gems of wisdom, so perhaps people will kindle and flare up with the fire of God in the tree of remembrance.</p>
<p>14) When Muhammad, the Messenger of God, intended to mention this highest station, to acquaint them with the secrets of Unity in the tree of his self, and to inform them of his independence from the fire that manifested in the Sinai of wisdom upon Moses, God revealed to him this Tauric verse to serve as a guide for those who were given the Torah, and as guidance for those guided by the lights of guidance in the Muhammadan Lote Tree. And God commanded Moses to give good tidings to the people about this Sinai in this Ahmadine locale and bear witness to that which was revealed in the Book. Indeed, we sent Moses with Our signs to bring the people from darkness into light, so give them good tidings of the days of God. This is what was inscribed in the Tablets, if you are aware. Indeed, he who gives good tidings to the people about His days, how does one reach His station, if you perceive.</p>
<p>15) Then know that Moses, with what he found comfort in from the fire of the tree on the bank of the valley of Security, was guided by it and was among those who, by God’s permission, enter into the blessed locale. And Muhammad, before finding comfort in anything or being touched by any fire, was made light for those in the heavens and the earth, and guided with this light whomever He willed among His creation. This is what is inscribed in the Book, which you read in the Criterion.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-lamp-and-the-glass" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lamp-and-the-glass">The Lamp and the Glass</h3>
<p>16) Then know that the station of the niche in this verse is the same, and the lamp is his illuminated heart, and the glass is his holy structure within which the lamp of Oneness is lit. From it the light is kindled and shines, and by it, everyone in the heavens and the earth is illuminated. Thus, we mention to you, if by this light you are illuminated in the days of the spirit.</p>
<p>17) Then after this light has been illuminated in the lamp of Muhammadan essence and kindled upon the niche of the Ahmadan essence, and the creation of Oneness has been completed in the structure of sanctity, God commanded to remind people of His meeting in the otherworldly resurrection. He gives them good news of the praiseworthy sanctified station in the abode where the assembly of the heavenly hosts and the spirits of those who are near [to God] are gathered. There, the clouds of Divine Grace are lifted and at that moment, the believers rejoice in God’s joy. This is what is promised in the preserved tablets, in His mighty saying on the Day when “your Lord comes or some of His signs arrive.” This is what has been promised to everyone in the heavens and the earth, so that everyone will testify within themselves that this is the Truth, there is no god but He, and indeed He is the Truth, the Knower of the unseen.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-one-who-came-with-alis-shirt" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-one-who-came-with-alis-shirt">The One Who Came with Ali’s Shirt</h3>
<p>18) Thus, know the station of the one who came with Ali’s shirt upon a cloud of light, and Muhammad, the Messenger of God, gave good tidings of meeting him on the day that the sincere ones rejoice. Then recognize, after he came to them with clear signs, what the fabricators said and what they did to him such that even the pen hesitates to record it. God bore witness to that even if you do not bear witness. They denied him and rejected him. Among them were those who said, “Has he fabricated this against God, or is he bewitching people with magic?” In this way, they veiled themselves from meeting God, did not respond to His command, and did not turn towards the direction toward which those who are near [to God] turn.</p>
<p>19) And you, O people of eloquence, be grateful to God for what He has generously given you, in that He has made Himself known to you and honored you with His meeting, and sent you forth with the truth. He has revealed to you that which suffices you beyond those who have disbelieved and associated others [with God], after everyone has been waiting for His days and have been promised thereof.</p>
<p>20) Thus, recognize what we have endowed you with, the truth, and honored you with grace. We have sheltered you on the shores of knowledge, taught you the paths of understanding, and drawn you near with the fire that has ignited the hearts of those who have believed and who constantly place their trust in their Lord, Allah.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-glass-vessels-of-possible-existence-were-illuminated" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-glass-vessels-of-possible-existence-were-illuminated">The Glass Vessels of Possible Existence Were Illuminated</h3>
<p>21) Then know that the purpose of the verse was nothing but what we have taught you in truth. However, only those who are patient in Allah will know it, and only the sincere will grasp it. This is from the grace that has not been preceded by the first and will not be surpassed by the last. Yet, you, O questioner, who hope for those days when the sun of care shone from the horizon of Oneness and the lamp of identity was lit in the niche of sanctity, will not witness this verse except in the structure that Allah has hidden behind the curtain of dignity, near the wing of His beloved. Do you not see how Allah ignited it for Himself with His own fire in the niche of eternity and safeguarded it with the lamp of power between the Earth and the sky, so that no breaths of associating partners with Allah would blow upon it? Light emerged from it behind seventy thousand veils to the extent of a needle’s eye, and from it, the glass vessels of possible existence were illuminated, each telling about Allah, their Creator, in what this divine fire has manifested to them. This is what we impart to you from the wonders of hidden knowledge, so you may thank your Lord Allah at all times, then all the believers, and be content with yourself for what has turned your heart towards the shore that no one of creation has ever reached, except those who are constantly consumed by the fire of love. And none shall approach it except those who have severed themselves from everyone in the realm of command and creation, and they tread the paths of submission by the permission of Allah.</p>
<p>22) Then we have sufficed with what we have explained to you in this holy verse and condensed in elucidating its meanings, because we have explained it before with various expressions and indications that bewilder the minds of those who know. Surely, be content with what has descended upon you on this blessed night, which Allah has made among the nights in which every decreed matter is determined, from an Almighty, Sustaining Lord. And if you are not content with what the pen of power has inscribed on those luminous tablets, return to what has been recorded before by the witnessed finger of glory, for in the Lote Tree of words, the fire of Oneness was kindled, and none shall draw from it except the monotheists. Upon its branches are doves, all created from the fire of love, and none shall hear their melodies except those who have detached themselves. By Allah, if you were to scrutinize with your sight, you would know all the sciences inscribed in these tablets and would be independent of anything else. Indeed, this is a known truth.</p>

<section id="about-the-disjointed-letters-in-the-scriptures" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-disjointed-letters-in-the-scriptures">About the Disjointed Letters in the Scriptures</h2>
<p>23) As for what you asked about the disjointed letters in the scriptures and Psalms, know that each of these letters has verses for those who understand. Within them are symbols, indications, meanings, and implications that none comprehend except those who are in the good pleasure of Allah and are steeped in the satisfaction of knowledge. Their secrets have always been concealed in the treasures of infallibility, sealed with the seal of power, and veiled with the mask of glory. But then its seal is broken for your sake and your love, for what people are able to comprehend, so that those who have been guided by Allah before may bear witness that all of this was created in the temple of the one who speaks the truth, around whom circle all the elevated letters and comprehensive words, if you understand.</p>
<section id="point-to-eternal-beings-and-unifying-realties" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="point-to-eternal-beings-and-unifying-realties">Point to Eternal Beings and Unifying Realties</h3>
<p>24) Know that those disjointed letters, in the context of the Names, point to the eternal beings, the unifying realities, and the essence of existence, just as you read in the Qur’an where His exalted Light said at the beginning of the book: “Alif Lam Mim, This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous.” In this station, Allah named His beloved with these expanded, disjointed letters so that those who soar on the wings of detachment in the air of the spirit may be certain of this.</p>
<p>25) Indeed, O Muhammad, this “Book” refers to the book of your own self, and this is from the preserved Book of the Unseen, knowledge of which no one can encompass except Allah. From it are detailed all other books, if you only realize. This is from the Book in which is detailed the knowledge of what was and what will be, and by it are guided those who seek guidance. Everything that has been revealed before from books and scriptures is but a letter from that Book. And none understand this except those who ascend toward the proximity of the Divine on the steed of Glory. All of this is mentioned in the context of description, yet this hidden Book has a station beyond which all mention and all description by describers ceases. Everything that was and will be is created by His word “Be, and it is.”</p>
</section>
<section id="the-book-of-your-own-self" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-book-of-your-own-self">The Book of Your Own Self</h3>
<p>26) Thus, recognize the Book of the Self of Muhammad, in which all the secrets have been inscribed by the Pen of Allah, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Self-Sustaining, so you may bear witness that there is no god but He, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Beloved. In this way, it was revealed before to read the Book of your own Self. This is the Book that suffices those who believe and guides them to the shore of the stored Name. In another station, it refers to the Book that was revealed to him in truth, and Allah made it a criterion between those who believe and those who disbelieve and are unjust toward their Lord.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-most-beautiful-names" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-most-beautiful-names">The Most Beautiful Names</h3>
<p>27) In yet another station, know that when Allah named His Beloved with composite letters and all-encompassing words, just as you pronounce His names as Muhammad, Ahmad, and Mahmud in the realm of Names, He also named him with expansive letters and fragmented symbols so that anyone who has understanding thereafter would know that all the most sublime letters and the most beautiful names were created for Him, because nothing appears from the Beloved except what is intended by the Lover. This you would see if you looked with the vision of the spirit. To affirm what was stated, the verse of Eternity says: “To whomsoever you pray, His are the most beautiful Names.” This was revealed before, and you have read, and in his days, most people read.</p>
</section>
<section id="imprints-reflected-from-the-sun" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="imprints-reflected-from-the-sun">Imprints Reflected from the Sun</h3>
<p>28) Then know that Allah created these expansive, fragmented letters in the name of His Beloved as essential expansiveness and subtle, elevated archetypes, just as you witness in the imprints reflected from the sun of Muhammadan light. Likewise, He created from the composite words in His name, structures that are limited and composed of elements of oneness, each according to the degree of their imprints from this sun. Therefore, ponder upon the creation of the heavens and the earth so that you understand every name in the shadow of His name, and every attribute in the shadow of His description, and be certain that everything is within the grasp of His power, created from letters. Be among those who peer into the manifestations of creation with the eye of Allah.</p>
</section>
<section id="three-stations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="three-stations">Three Stations</h3>
<p>29) In another station, the ‘Alif’ signifies the Absolute Divinity, and the ‘Lam’ indicates the Absolute Guardianship, which refers back to His self-sustaining essence, as stated: “Verily, your guardian is Allah.” This is from the guardianship of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. The ‘Meem’ is about the Muhammadi reality and the Ahmadic pattern. Allah addressed him with these letters so that all may be certain that everything expressed in language, mentioned by the tongues of creation, or realized in the land of creation, all of that has appeared in the attire of Muhammadi essence. Likewise, this suffices you, if you listen.</p>
<p>30) By Allah, if I were to elaborate on these three stations in these three letters, neither tablets would suffice nor would ink ever run dry. However, it’s succinctly expressed in each station if you but know. The reins of the pen were not in my grasp, out of fear for those who have disbelieved and committed polytheism. If there was any resentment in their hearts for this youth who resides in the region of Iraq, and calls everyone to the Path, and has illuminated from the horizon of Oneness, lighting up all horizons. Thus, we mention some of the secrets of the matter, so that perhaps you may become enlightened. Otherwise, by He in Whose hand is the soul of Hussain, were I not restrained by the machinations of the hypocrites, I would write on the Tablet what would sever you from everyone in the heavens and the earth and elevate you to a station that neither ears have heard nor eyes have perceived. This everlasting bounty will never cease, even if it flows from the beginning which has no beginning to the end which none will witness, because the source of this Divine Spring and this Ocean of Oneness is nothing but the true bounty of the Lordly and the existential knowledge of the Eternal. How could this ever-running purity ever run out? By my Lord, it will neither run out nor vanish, and that is testified by what we have deduced as proof, and beyond that the inhabitants of the celestial realms also testify. Does the bounty of Allah ever end or His outpouring ever cease? By the Lord of the heavens and the earth, His mercy precedes all things and His bounty encompasses all existence.</p>
<p>31) Say, O people, this is from His bounty that descends upon you from the clouds of knowledge, rains of wisdom, and grants unto the contingent beings that which enters them into the pleasure of the Sacred and clothes them in the garment of eternity, if you ponder the secrets of this bounty.</p>
