<p>1 Oh Salman, let’s soar from the city of the soul to the holy paradise of the Merciful, to the people of the universe and the possibilities. Allow us to pass, with feet of perseverance and wings of detachment, and a heart ablaze with the love of God. Keep walking until the cold of winter has no effect on you and it does not prevent you from journeying in the valley of oneness.</p>
<p>2 Oh Salman, * these days, the manifestation of the firm word is evidenced by “La ilaha illa Hu”. What that means is that the word of negation has taken precedence over the word of affirmation because of its essential nature and its manifestation. Until now, none of the innovators have paid attention to this divine subtlety, and what has been observed is that the letters of negation on the surface have always prevailed over the letters of affirmation. This is because the divine wisdom has concealed the effect of this word and has given priority to the collection of negations. If I mention the convincing and fully encompassing wisdoms, surely one would be astonished, even dead, from witnessing them. What you observe on earth, even if apparently contrary to the outward will, is the result of temporary circumstances. However, in essence, it has always been and will always be in accordance with the divine will. If one reflects upon this tablet and contemplates the mentioned word, they will become informed by a divine decree like never before. This is because the words are the treasure of truth, and the meanings deposited within them are the pearls of divine science. The supreme one, through the hand of divine protection, prevents people from gaining knowledge about them. When the will of God takes effect, and the hand of power opens the seal, people will then turn their attention to it. For example, in the words of the Qur’an, all the treasuries of divine knowledge and beauty existed, and throughout nights and days, scholars read and wrote commentaries about them. Yet, they were incapable of manifesting even a single letter of the concealed pearls within the treasures of these words. When the promised one appears, the hand of power will unlock the treasures for people according to their own capacity and readiness. Thus, even the children of this age, who have not grasped the external sciences, will become informed about the hidden secrets according to their ability, to the extent that a child would challenge the scholars of this age in expressing them. This is the power of the divine hand and the encompassing nature of the will of the supreme one. If someone contemplates on this mentioned statement, they will observe that not a single atom moves except by the divine will, and no one becomes aware of an ocean unless it is by His permission. Exalted is His rank, exalted is His power, exalted is His sovereignty, exalted is His greatness, exalted is His command, and exalted is His favor upon those in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>3 Oh Salman, the pen of Rahman says: In this manifestation, I have removed the negative from the affirmation, and if Allah wills, the decree will be revealed from the sky of His will. And then, we will have our sending.</p>
<p>4 Oh Salman, such sorrows have surrounded me that the tongue of Rahman is prevented from mentioning sublime matters. I swear by the Nurturer of possibilities that the doors of divine pleasure have been closed due to the oppression of the polytheists, and the breezes of divine knowledge from the right hand of exalted oneness have been cut off.</p>
<p>5 Oh Salman, my trials have been apparent from before and after, limited to these days only. Know that throughout the months and years, I have been nurtured by mercy. I have risen to kill because if I mention the secrets of the past, I shall be informed that some of the servants who have been created by the Almighty’s command have always wanted to oppose the truth and deviated from the innovations of His command. Look at Harut and Marut, who were two divine servants, so holy that they came to be called angels. They were surrounded by the ocean of non-existence and came into existence, their mention recorded in the heavens and earth, and their traces famous.</p>
<p>They were so close to God that the tongue of His greatness spoke of their fame until they reached a position where they saw themselves as the most pious, highest, and most devoted of all the servants. Then a breeze from the lust of temptation blew and they were thrown into the lowest flames. The details of these two angels, which are mentioned among people, are mostly lies and far from the truth. We have knowledge of everything in the preserved tablets of glory.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no one has objected to the truth about why the nations of that time did not take this position after the maturity of these two angels to the positions of the sanctity and closeness to God.</p>
<p>6 Hey Salman, tell those who speak that you should not turn the everlasting heavenly chain and the eternal divine Kauthar into salty water, and do not erase the melodies of the immortal nightingale from hearing. Walk in the shadow of the expanding cloud of mercy and reside in the shade of the divine Sidra tree.</p>
<p>7 Oh Salman, the truth has always been apparent among people, and all prophets and messengers have been commanded to rule justly among their people. It is not permissible for anyone else to do so. For example, consider the state of a believer and a monotheist, in whom the sun of monotheism shines so that they admit and acknowledge all the divine names and attributes. They bear witness to all that the beauty of their existence bears witness to themselves. In this position, all descriptions of them are true and valid; in fact, no one is capable of describing them as they truly are except God Himself. All these descriptions are related to the divine manifestation that the sovereign has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p>In this position, if someone denies them, they have actually denied the truth, because what is seen in them is nothing but divine manifestations as long as they remain in this position. If even a word of good is said about them, the speaker of it would have been and will be a liar.</p>
<p>After denunciation, description returns to being ordinary, and all the attributes attributed to them earlier cease to apply. The person is no longer the same as before, and those attributes do not remain in them. If one looks with the eye of discernment, they can see that the person who wore that garment before has not, and will not wear it again. A believer, while in faith and admitting God and believing in Him, even if their clothes are made of cotton, are considered heaven’s silk in the eyes of the Lord. But after denying, their garment turns into the tar and flame of Hell.</p>
<p>In such a case, if someone describes such a person in the earlier flattering terms, they would be considered a liar, and in God’s eyes, they are among the people of Hell’s fire.</p>
<p>8 O Salman, I have placed the reasons for this statement in all things, each by itself. Yet, it is very surprising that people have not paid attention to it and have slipped in the manifestation of such matters. Observe the lamp while it is bright and luminous and burning; if someone denies the light of it, he is surely a liar. However, after the breeze blows and extinguishes it, if someone says it is shining, he has been and will be a liar. Although the niche and the candle have been and will be the same during light and darkness.</p>
<p>9 O Salman, today observe everything in the mirror, for they were created by a single word and are established as one in the presence of God. And if they all pay attention to this magnificent sun that has risen from the horizon of the divine sanctity, they will all be reflected and imprinted in every manifestation of the sun. In this way, all the characteristics and qualities of the sun are true upon that mirror, for what is seen in that mirror is nothing but the sun and its light. And it is proven to the discerning mystic that these qualities of the mirror are not due to itself, but rather to that manifestation which has appeared and shone forth from the eastern horizon of the sun’s favor in that mirror.</p>
<p>And as long as this manifestation remains, these qualities shall endure, and after the erasure of this disclosure from the mirror image, the description regarding these qualities of the mirror shall be considered as mere falsehood and utter fabrication. For the names and attributes revolve around the manifestation that shone forth from the sun, not around the mirror by themselves for their own sake.</p>
<p>10 Oh Salman, the honor of every name and its elevation and greatness and fame is in relation to God. For example, observe the houses that have been raised among different nations, all of which are considered sacred, and people visit them from distant places. It is clear that the respect for these houses is due to their association with the beauty of the divine footsteps, even though every wise person knows that the beauty of the divine footsteps is not in need of any house, nor will it ever be. But the relationship of all places to His holy essence has been equal. Rather, He has placed these houses and similar ones as a means of salvation and prosperity for His servants so that He does not deprive all of His creation of the manifestations of His grace. Blessed is the one who follows God’s command and does what he has been ordained to do and is among the successful ones.</p>
<p>These houses and their pilgrims are honored by God, as long as this relationship is not severed, and after the severance of the relationship, if someone becomes a pilgrim, he will only be a pilgrim to himself and will be counted among the people of hell in the sight of God. Similarly, observe the houses of the souls that, after turning away from God’s rule, have become idols, and their worshippers in the sight of God are among the idolatrous servants and will continue to be so.</p>
<p>Reflect on how these houses have been the same in both their relationship with God and after the severance of that relationship, and their outward appearance remains the same, so that their outward appearance is observed in the same way in both states, such that there is no noticeable change in the outward appearance of these houses, whether in their relationship or otherwise. But during the cutting of the relationship, the hidden and covered spirit is taken away from these houses, and only the wise ones can comprehend it. Similarly, observe in all the manifestations of the names that are the houses of the souls.</p>
<p>11 O Salman, observe the words of the Merciful with a pure heart and a holy sight, and reflect so that you may perhaps achieve the will of God.</p>
<p>12 O Salman, during his exit from Iraq, the tongue of God informed everyone that Samri would appear and hasten to summons, and the birds of the night would move after the disappearance of the sun. Those two appeared however soon the night birds would rise under the pretext of lordship and divinity. Nevertheless, we ask God to make people know themselves, lest they should exceed their limits and their affairs, and remember God with this great remembrance, and assist God with all their limbs and pillars, and be like banners between heaven and earth. Dwell, O people, in the shade of God, then settle on your seats with the tranquility of God and great dignity. And hold on to the rope of servitude. By God, the truth is surely a matter unequaled by anything created between heaven and earth. By it, the command of God will be revealed among his servants and his creatures, and whoever adheres to it in those days will truly support God, and whoever lags behind it will be arrogant to God, and none will be arrogant but every transgressor is sinful. If God wills, all will dwell and rest in the shadow of the beauty of his presence and look towards his side, and indeed this is a great bounty.</p>
<p>13 And now that you have asked about the meaning of the poem, although the pen of good fortune has not been able to move on the meanings of the poem, today, with the ocean of meanings and their roots revealed, there is no longer any need for previous words. Rather, all people of knowledge, wisdom, and mysticism, before and after, have needed and will need to be with these wondrous, undulating oceans. But a brief account of your request will be mentioned and, with the permission of God, the pen will proceed on what it intends.</p>
<p>14 Question: Since color turned into a prisoner of color, Moses became in conflict with Moses.</p>
<p>15 Oh Salman, there are many statements about Arifa in examples like these articles. Some have considered the essence of the sea and its waves as creatures, and they say that the difference in the waves is due to their forms. And forms are accidents, and after the removal of all forms, everything returns to the sea, meaning they are the essence of the sea. And in the forms, they have shown some other statements that it is not permissible to mention in this place. In the same way, they have mentioned the essence as a pencil and other objects as letters and said that the same essence of the pencil appears in different forms of letters, and these forms are, in fact, the essence of the same pencil. They called the first the place of unity and the second the place of plurality. In the same way, they considered the essence as one and objects as numbers, and the essence as water, and objects as ice, as they have said.</p>
<p>16 And in another place they said:</p>
<p>17 The scholars consider everything as manifestations of the essential self-disclosure of the Divine. They have mentioned three types of self-disclosure: essential, attributive, and active. They have considered the existence of things in relation to the Divine as a form of appearance. If all these matters are mentioned in detail, it may cause listeners to become alienated from the essence of knowledge. They also believe in the existence of fixed entities within the Divine Essence. One wise scholar has said, “The realities of things exist in the Divine Essence in a most sublime way, then He bestows them upon creation.” They do not consider the Giver of things as lacking anything and believe it is impossible. Ibn Arabi has written an extensive explanation on this subject. The wise scholars and latter-day scholars, like Sadr al-Shirazi and Fayd, have followed the same path as Ibn Arabi.</p>
<p>Fortunate are those who walk on the red slope on the shore of this sea, where the images and apparitions are renewed by each wave. How pleasant it is for those who strip themselves of all signs and indications and dive into this ocean, its depths, and reach the whale of meanings and pearls of its wisdom, which were created in it. Congratulations to the winners!</p>
<p>Every soul who believes in mystical explanations and has traveled on that path, considers both Moses and Pharaoh as manifestations of the Divine. However, they consider the former as a manifestation of the names such as Guide, Mighty, and the like, and the latter as a manifestation of names such as Misguider, Humiliator, and the like. Therefore, the dispute between the two is justified, and after removing human determinations, they regard both as one, just as they regard the essence of all things as one. The summary of these matters has been mentioned before.</p>
<p>Some of the people, of which only a few have been briefly mentioned here, but O Salman, the Pen of Rahman states that today, the supporters and deniers of these statements are on the same level, since the sun of truth is shining by itself not from an eternal unseen horizon. Every soul who is preoccupied with these explanations will, of course, be deprived of the recognition of the beauty of Rahman. The spring of the investigation of illusions is the time of absence, and today is the spring of uncovering and encounter. Say, “O people! Enjoy these days in the gardens of revelation and witnessing, then leave the illusions.” Thus, your command is the command of God, the Dominant, the Sustainer.</p>
<p>The purpose of mentioning all the sciences has been to acquire knowledge, and the statement of specific evidences to prove the signified. Now, thanks be to God, the sun of knowledge rises from the horizon of the divine sky, and the moon of the signified appears in the sky of the command. To reveal the truth, cleanse all the sacred indications from it, and observe the sun of meanings in the spiritual celestial sky with the outward eye. Also observe the manifestations of divine names and attributes in everything other than Him, so that you may attain all the sciences and their source, origin, and mine.</p>
<p>18 Oh Salman, I swear by the beauty of the step that during these days, new knowledge descends from the skies of God’s knowledge of the worlds every moment. Blessed is the one who turns to this source and cuts off from what is with him. O people of attraction and longing, be fair in these statements, which are briefly mentioned by the Sufis in their books. Our situation cannot be counted among people. If a person intends to understand everything, two lifetimes would not be enough.</p>
<p>19 Oh Salman, say that Allah is manifest above all things, and on that day, the kingdom belongs to Allah, then leave people with what they have. Leave the knowledge of the past behind. Moses, who is one of the greatest prophets, according to the mystics, annihilated his actions in the actions of God during his first thirty days, his attributes in the attributes of God during his second thirty days, and his essence in the essence of God during his third thirty days. And they said that since the remainder of his existence was still remaining in him, therefore, he heard the address, “You will not see me.” And now the tongue of Allah is speaking and says, “Show me once and become victorious a hundred thousand times by visiting the Almighty.” Where is the grace of these days compared to the previous days?</p>
<p>20 O Salman, all that the mystics have mentioned are entirely in the domain of creation and always will be, such that even the highest souls and purest hearts, no matter how much they soar in the heavens of knowledge and gnosis, cannot exceed their rank of being created beings, and they cannot escape from being creations within their own selves by their own selves. All the knowledge of every knower, all the remembrances of every rememberer, and all the descriptions of every describer ultimately come to an end in what his Lord has created within his own self as a manifestation. And every single being, in the end, proves himself by reflecting on his own existence, although it is not possible for a created being to surpass his own limit. All the analogies and knowledge from the beginning of the world have referred to creations that exist from the realm of divine possibility, not from any created thing.</p>
<p>So, exalted is Allah that He should be known by the knowledge of anyone, or that any person’s self should be attributed to Him. There has never been any connection, attachment, indication, or reference between Him and His creation. And He has created all the possible beings by His will, which encompasses all the worlds. The truth is that He has always been and will always be sanctified from the knowledge of possible beings in the loftiness of His sovereignty, transcendent in the exaltation of the impossibility of knowing Him, and unattainable by the perception of all created beings.</p>
<p>All those in the heavens and the earth have been created by His Word, and they have come into existence from absolute nonexistence. How can it be that a creature, which is created by the Word, can elevate itself to the level of the eternal essence?</p>
<p>21 Oh Salman, every path has been blocked by essence, and every way will be cut off; and only by the grace and favor of the sunrise appearing from the horizon of oneness among people, making the knowledge of these sacred souls known as their own knowledge. Whoever knows them has truly known God, and whoever hears their words has heard the words of God, and whoever acknowledges them has acknowledged God, and whoever turns away from them has turned away from God, and whoever disbelieves in them has disbelieved in God. They are the path of God between the heavens and the earth and the measure of God in the realm of command and creation, and they are the manifestation of God and His proofs among His servants and His signs among His creation.</p>
<p>22 O Salman, disconnect from everything famous between the people and with the wings of detachment, soar towards the heavens of the sanctified and glorious realm. By Allah, if you would fly towards it and reach the axis of its meanings, you would not see anything in existence except the radiant aspects of the Beloved’s Presence and you would not see those who have turned away as if none of them had ever been mentioned. Mention of this station requires a different tongue for remembering and another ear for listening.</p>
<p>23 O Salman, it’s better that we entrust the secrets of our soul and the creative invocations of our beloved to the sky of the Merciful’s will, and embark on the meaning of poetry.</p>
<p>24 The purpose of mentioning Musa and Pharaoh in the Mathnawi was to give an example, not to suggest that they were one in reality. God forbid such a thing! For Pharaoh and the likes of him were created by the word of Musa. And if you know, the apparent differences between them indicate that they were opposites throughout the worlds. That is the hidden knowledge that only the perceptive knower can understand.</p>
<p>The author of Mathnawi assumes that all people are in the domain of the names of Musa because everyone was created from and will return to dust. Similarly, everyone is marked with the letters of Musa in the world of spirits. In the world of one-color, there has never been conflict, and there will never be any conflict since the causes of conflict are not observable. However, after the spirits enter the bodies and appear in this world, the causes of conflict arise, whether they be truth or falsehood.</p>
<p>If this conflict and struggle is for establishing the divine order, then it is truth and will remain so. Otherwise, it is falsehood. Love, hypocrisy, acceptance, and rejection all revolve around these causes. For example, observe that one cause appears from the source, and this cause is single. But, it changes in every breath according to its circumstances, and its effects become apparent in every stage of its manifestation in various ways.</p>
<p>For example, consider the divine name “Al-Mughni,” which means “the enricher” - this name in its own domain is single, but after reflecting in the mirror of human existence, the effect of its manifestation appears in every breath according to one’s requirements. For example, in the generous, it appears as generosity; in the miser, it appears as stinginess; in the unfortunate, it appears as misery; and in the fortunate, it appears as happiness.</p>
<p>In the state of poverty, the people’s souls and what is in them are hidden. For example, a person who has no money has his generosity and stinginess hidden. Likewise, happiness and misery are not observable at this stage. After wealth appears, in every breath, what is in them will become apparent and observable. For example, a person who becomes a master of something will spend it in the way of Allah. Another person will arrange the means of warfare and rise to oppose and argue with the truth. Yet another person will preserve everything, depriving both himself and others of his wealth.</p>
<p>Now, notice how a single manifestation creates a variety of different effects. Before the manifestation, all these souls were dormant, hidden, and subdued in their places. By one manifestation of the sun of the name “Al-Mughni,” these souls were gathered together, showing what was hidden in their inner world.</p>
<p>If you look with insight into this statement, you will become aware of the hidden secrets. Observe Pharaoh at the time when, if not for the appearance of wealth and power, he would never have risen to fight against the beauty of Oneness. For, he would have been helpless and weak in the absence of circumstances, and his disbelief would be hidden. Blessed be the souls who are not captivated by the colors of the world and what has been created in them and have become successful with the color of Allah. That is, they have come to this wondrous appearance on the color of truth.</p>
<p>Purification from all the various colors of the world is for those who know about this color; like the people of today who consider themselves to be on the ship of survival and in the ocean of greatness. They recognize one another, but those who are ignorant of this color cannot understand. And if they become knowledgeable, they only perceive as much as a blind person perceives the sun.</p>
<p>25 Hey Salman, tell the worshippers to step into the sea so that they become purified from all colors and enter the holiest and purest place and the greatest view.</p>
<p>26 O Salman, all the servants of various colors in the world are forbidden from the shining shore of sanctity. For instance, observe the well-known ego that is inclined to war. I swear by the sun of the horizon of meanings that it was always a part of my life, day and night. In the early morning when I was in bed, it was standing at the head of the one who arose, and the verses of God were being recited upon him. It served the one who arose throughout the day and night.</p>
<p>But when the matter elevated and became manifest, its name was so overshadowed by the color of the name and the love of leadership that it became deprived of the oneness of the sacred shore. I swear by the One Who has created the essence of this soul in the love of leadership and position that It has never been seen before. I swear by the One Who has made everything speak its praise that if all the people of origination would try to count the envy and hatred of this soul, they would find themselves incapable of doing so.</p>
<p>We ask God to purify its breast, return it to itself and support it in acknowledging the Omnipotent, Most High, and Great God.</p>
<p>27 O Salman, consider the matter of God so that a word from the tongue of the manifestation of His Oneness would appear. That word in itself is one, and it has appeared from one source. But after the illumination of the sun, the word from the horizon of God’s mouth appears to the servants at every moment according to what is upon them. For example, in one person there is aversion, and in another attraction. Similarly, there is love and hatred and the like. Then these lovers and haters rise up to fight and oppose one another, although before the appearance of the Word, they were friends and united, and after the illumination of the Sun, that Word is adorned with the color of God. In the averter, it is adorned with the color of the self and desire. The illumination of this divine Word appears in the receptive soul with the color of attraction and in the averter’s soul with the color of aversion, even though the original illumination was pure of colors.</p>
<p>Look at the Sun, which appears in mirrors and glasses in a single manifestation, but its color appears differently in each glass. As you see and observe, the reason for the dispute between the averter and the receptive is color, but there is an innumerable difference between these two colors. This one has appeared with the color of God, and that one with the color of desire. The color of the believing receptive one who strives is the color of the Merciful, and the color of the averter hypocrite is the color of Satan. That color is the cause and reason for the purification of souls from the colors of other than God, and this is the cause of staining souls with the various colors of the self and desire. That is the everlasting life, this is the everlasting death. That guides the severed ones to the fountain of everlastingness, and this one makes the veiled ones taste the bitter fruit of annihilation. From that there is the fragrance of the Merciful in the review, and from this there are the evil-smelling odors of Satan.</p>
<p>The purpose of the author of the Mathnawi in these words was not that Moses and Pharaoh were of the same rank. Refuge be with God from that, as some ignorant people have understood. The action of Moses is a testimony to his sincerity, since his dispute was for God’s sake, and the purpose was to save Pharaoh from the transient colors and make him win in the color of God, and to taste the drink of martyrdom in the path of the Beloved. But Pharaoh’s dispute was to preserve his life and kingdom. The purpose of Moses is to ignite the lamp of God among us, and the purpose of Pharaoh is to extinguish it. So, is the one who spends his soul in the way of God equal to the one who preserves his soul behind seventy thousand veils? How is it that these people cannot understand a clear statement from the All-Knowing, All-Wise God?</p>
<p>No, the purpose of the author of the Mathnawi is that the cause of the war between Moses and Pharaoh has been color, but the color of Moses was a color for which the inhabitants of the highest celestial realm have sacrificed themselves, and the color of Pharaoh was a color from which the dwellers of the lowest hell have refrained. The author of Mathnawi himself has mentioned Pharaoh in many places, and if you look, you will apprehend that it was not his purpose that some attribute to him. And to what extent has he expressed his longing to be united with the divine lovers and to be successful in serving the friends of truth? This is what he mentions in some positions.</p>
<p>28 O Salman! To the righteous devotees say: Let no one charge you with objection in the words of any critic, for only mercy and compassion shall they observe in your sight. However, for those souls who today in the rejection of God’s Tablets have written fiery verdicts on all souls, it is inevitable that, as far as their ability permits them to do so, they shall write in rejection of me what they have rejected of God, just as has been ordained from an Omnipotent and Omnipotent authority.</p>
<p>What is the proof today for the victory of the truth is by the mention and explanation not by the sword and the like. Thus have We revealed before, and if ye then knew. So let him who would speak of the matter say: Verily there is no god but He. If a soul has a word written in rejection of me, and is rejected by God, let such a one be honored with a standing of grace so that all the people of the high court may envy that position.</p>
<p>And all the possible quills are impotent to mention that position, and the tongues of all beings are incapable of describing it. - Let every man today rise higher and higher in this holiest cause, putting all aside that is in the heavens and on earth. - and God was a witness to that, well aware - do not you, O beloved of God, take your ease on the cushions of comfort when you know your Creator and hear what has come from Him. Then arise in victory, speak out and do not be silent, nor with less than that perseverance; for this is better for you than the treasures of what has been and what is to be if you are of them who know. Such is the advice of the pen for the highest servants of God.</p>
<p>29 Oh Salman, know that never has anyone among the servants who possessed intellect in the whole, said that the fortunate and the averted, the monotheist and the polytheist are in the same status and degree. And what you have heard or seen in some of the previous books, the purpose is in the sacred extraction of the truth. And it has been mentioned that the names in the celestial realm are one. Do not consider the celestial realm imaginary, for today the celestial realm, the realm of power, and the divine realm are all part of the heavenly faction. And from the abundance of these stages and worlds which are visible in this position, the worlds of the divine, the powerful, and the celestial, and beyond them are present and established in their proper places. A detailed explanation of these stations is not allowed, and it is suspended in the celestial realm of will until Allah sends it down with His Grace, and indeed, He is capable of all things.</p>
<p>In the sacred realm of truth, all names have been and will be one, and this is before the appearance of the Word of Separation. For example, observe that today, all manifestations of names are evident before God in their own kingdom. And likewise, the study of qualities and everything that has been, and by the adjustment of the structure of eternity, are related to the throne of justice, equally for all. But after the casting of the Word of Separation and distinction, it is present and evident among the servants. So that every soul who is successful in saying the word “Yes,” will receive all goodness.</p>
<p>By the sorrow of the beauty of the Almighty, a position has been determined for the fortunate ones that if the slightest bit of its glory appeared on Earth, all would perish from yearning. This is why the positions of the faithful are concealed from the faithful themselves during their apparent life. And every soul that did not become certain in the mention of “Yes” before Allah is not mentioned. So we seek refuge in Allah from what has been decreed for him from the punishment which has no measure.</p>
<p>30 Hey Salman, convey the words of mercy to the worshippers and tell them to protect themselves from the wolves of the earth. Do not listen to the ornate words that some utter, and purify your hearing for listening to my words. Keep your hearts pure for the knowledge of my beauty, separate from all that is created.</p>
<p>31 O Salman! * Enough for you to enact that at dawn, the beauty of the Chosen One manifested on your hearts and occupied you with His own essence, and then returned to the abode of his own dwelling *</p>
<p>32 Oh Salman * Say, oh worshippers, walk in the path of truth and contemplate the manifestations of actions, and ponder on His words * So that, perhaps, you will be rewarded eternally by the source of abundance and glory * And if the accepter and the rejecter are in the same position and the divine worlds are only limited to this world, He would never have allowed His earlier manifestations to be captured by the enemies and to sacrifice their lives * I swear by the sun of the divine command that if the people knew a drop of the love and longing for the chosen beauty while they were hanging that eternal temple in the air, all of them would give their lives in the way of this divine glory * Praise be to God, they have given parrots and turned into dung * The crow remains without share from the songs of the nightingale * And the bat flees from the ray of the sun *.</p>
<p>33 O Salman, my suffering among nations and governments is a strong reason and a firm argument. In twenty years, I haven’t easily drank any water and haven’t slept comfortably through any night. Sometimes I have been chained, and sometimes captive and prisoner. If we had been indifferent to the world and what is upon it, we would have never been involved in these afflictions. Blessed is the soul which will be rewarded for the fruits of this position and tastes their sweetness.</p>
<p>Ask God for clear vision and seek a healthy palate, because the images of Joseph and the wolf are the same in the sight of the blind, and hanzhal and sugar are equal in the palate of the sick. However, I hope that some souls will emerge from the sacred breaths of these days, who will not buy the world and what is upon it for a penny, and they will watch over everything but Allah in the name of Allah. They will consider giving their lives in the cause of Rahman as the easiest thing, and they will not slip from the straight path because of the delinquency of the deviants.</p>
<p>They will choose to dwell in the shade of the friend. Oh, what a blessing and good news for these souls! What dignity and honor for them! By Allah, the heavenly maidens in the highest chambers are restless from their longing to meet these souls, and the people of the eternal abode are insatiable from their eagerness. Likewise, Allah chose these people for Himself and made them separated from the worlds.</p>
<p>34 Oh Salman, * Rahman’s pen has prevented the mention of one’s rank from sorrows * a harm to such a high position that if we all were present at the table of his grace and were indulged to the very end, none would ever be accused of stinginess * And with the pretext that our wages have been cut off * Observe the vulgarity and lowliness of their nature that to attract attention from people and to impute to the beauty of that exalted one, they write and send such pretexts * Despite the fact that you were here and saw that this servant never looked at their wages and what exists outside is divided up and given to everyone in turn * Yet they have taken up this practice of wasting God’s cause and collecting their wages as you have heard * I swear by the beauty of the footsteps that the first harm that befell this servant was accepting the wages from the government, and had it not been for these souls, I would certainly not have accepted it * And you have become aware that the matter has become difficult for the immigrants, yet we are all grateful and are satisfied and patient in God’s decree. Only what God decreed for us shall befall us. We rely on Him in all our affairs.</p>
<p>And these people who complain about the cut-off of wages and act in pretense, claim to have God’s dominion and turn away from the truth. * Pay attention to those souls who are following this group * Woe unto them and those who follow them, for soon they will be seized by the force of authority from the mighty, omnipotent, the everlasting Lord, and will find no helper or supporter for themselves * Thus the truth has been revealed by God the mighty, the beloved, the glorious * And glory be upon you, O Salman, and upon those who have not sold the words of God for unverifiable assumptions.</p>
