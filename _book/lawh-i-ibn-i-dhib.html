<p>In the name of Allah, the Unique, the One, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to Allah, the Eternal, the Everlasting, the Standing without change, the Dominant by His sovereignty, the Manifest by His signs, and the Hidden by His mysteries. By His command, the banner of the supreme word was raised in the human realm of creation, and He established the standard of “He does what He wills” among the people.</p>
<p>He is the One who revealed His command to guide His creation and sent down His verses to manifest His proof and evidence. He adorned the page of the Book of Man with His revelation, saying: “The Most Merciful taught the Quran, created man, and taught him eloquence.” There is no god but Him, the Unique, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>He is the radiant light from the horizon of the sky of generosity and the shining sun from the dawn of the will of Allah, the Sovereign of the kingdom of names. Upon the great intermediary and the supreme pen, which Allah has made the source of His most beautiful names and the dawn of His highest attributes. Through Him, the light of oneness shone from the horizon of the world, and the rule of singularity was established among the nations who turned with radiant faces to the highest horizon and acknowledged what the tongue of revelation proclaimed in the realm of understanding. The dominion and the kingdom, the grandeur and the power, belong to Allah, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>O noble scholar, heed the call of the oppressed. He advises you for the sake of Allah and admonishes you with what brings you closer to Him in all conditions. He is the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Know that ears were created to listen to the call on this day, which was mentioned in the books, scriptures, and tablets.</p>
<p>First, purify yourself with the water of detachment and adorn your head with the crown of piety, and your body with the garment of reliance on Allah. Then arise from your place, turning towards the Greatest House, the circumambulation site for those in the world from the Everlasting Sovereign.</p>
<section id="a-prayer-for-the-scholar-to-say-to-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-prayer-for-the-scholar-to-say-to-god">A Prayer for the Scholar to Say to God</h3>
<p>Say: “O my God, my God, my goal, my adored one, my lord, my support, the utmost of my hope and my aspiration, I see myself turning towards You, clinging to the cord of Your bounty, holding fast to the hem of Your grace, and acknowledging the sanctity of Your Essence and the purity of Your Being, affirming Your oneness and singleness. I bear witness that You are the Unique, the One, the Eternal. You have no partner in Your dominion, nor a peer on the earth. The beings have testified to what the tongue of Your majesty has testified before them, that You are Allah, there is no god but You. You have always been sanctified beyond the mention of Your servants and exalted above the description of Your creatures.</p>
<p>O Lord, You see the ignorant one approaching the sea of Your knowledge, the thirsty one desiring the fountain of Your utterance, the lowly one seeking the shelter of Your might, the poor one seeking the treasure of Your wealth, the beggar seeking the dawn of Your wisdom, the weak one seeking the rise of Your power, the needy one seeking the sky of Your generosity, and the worn-out one seeking the kingdom of Your mention. I testify, O my God and my Sovereign, that You created me for Your remembrance and praise and to assist Your Cause, and indeed, I have supported Your enemies who broke Your covenant, discarded Your book, and disbelieved in You and Your signs. Ah, ah, from my heedlessness and my shame, my sin, and my guilt which prevented me from entering the mighty sea of Your oneness and the vast ocean of Your mercy. Ah, ah, then ah, ah from my wretched state and my great disobedience. You have revealed me, O my God, to exalt Your word and manifest Your Cause, but my heedlessness has prevented me and surrounded me to the extent that I rose to erase Your traces and shed the blood of Your chosen ones and the dawns of Your signs, the sources of Your revelation, and the treasures of Your mysteries.</p>
<p>O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, I testify that by my injustice the fruits of the tree of Your justice fell, and by the fire of my disobedience, the hearts of the near ones among Your creation burned, and the livers of the sincere ones among Your servants melted. Ah, ah from my misery, ah, ah from my injustice, ah, ah from my remoteness, my heedlessness, my ignorance, my humiliation, my turning away, and my opposition. How many days have You commanded Your servants and friends to preserve me, and I commanded them to harm You and Your trustees. How many nights have You reminded me of Your grace and guided me to Your path, and I turned away from You and Your signs. By Your might, O hope of the monotheists and the aspiration of the hearts of the detached ones, I find no helper for myself but You, nor any other sovereign besides You, nor any refuge or shelter. Ah, ah, my turning away burned the veil of my chastity, and my opposition tore the curtain of my sanctity. I wish I had been under layers of dust and my evil deeds had not appeared among Your servants.</p>
<p>O Lord, You see the sinner turning to the dawning place of Your forgiveness and bounty, and the mountain of injustice seeking the sky of Your mercy and pardon. Ah, ah, my great transgressions prevented me from approaching the court of Your mercy, and my major sins distanced me from the vicinity of Your closeness. I am the one who neglected Your right, broke Your covenant and Your pact, and committed what made the inhabitants of the cities of Your justice and the dawns of Your grace in Your lands lament. I testify, O my God, that I abandoned Your commands and followed my own commands, discarded the judgments of Your book, and took the book of my desires. Ah, ah, whenever my misery increased, Your forbearance increased, and whenever the fire of my disobedience blazed, Your forgiveness and grace covered it. By Your might, O desired one of the world and beloved of the nations, Your patience deceived me, and Your endurance encouraged me. You see, O my God, my tears from my shame and my sighs from my heedlessness. By Your greatness, I find no place for myself except the shadow of the canopy of Your generosity, nor any escape but under the domes of Your mercy. You see me in the sea of despair and hopelessness after You made me hear the word “Do not despair.” By Your might, my injustice severed the cord of my hope, and my disobedience blackened my face before the throne of Your justice.</p>
<p>O Lord, You see the dead one lying before the gate of Your bounty and feeling ashamed to ask for the fountain of Your forgiveness from the hand of Your grace. You have given me a tongue for Your remembrance and praise, and it spoke what melted the livers of the near ones among Your chosen ones and burned the hearts of the sincere ones among the inhabitants of Your holy sanctuaries. You have given me sight to behold Your traces, observe Your signs, and the manifestations of Your craftsmanship, and I disregarded Your will and did what made the sincere ones among Your creation and the detached ones among Your servants wail. You gave me hearing to hear Your remembrance and praise and what You revealed from the sky of Your generosity and the air of Your will. Ah, ah, I abandoned Your command and commanded Your servants to curse Your trustees and friends, and I did before the throne of Your justice what caused the sighs of the monotheists and the sincere ones among the inhabitants of Your kingdom to rise.</p>
<p>I do not know, O my God, which of my sins to mention before the waves of the ocean of Your bounty, and which of my transgressions to speak of before the manifestations of the lights of the suns of Your favors and kindnesses. I ask You at this moment, by the secrets of Your book and what was hidden in Your knowledge, and by the pearls hidden in the shells of the oceans of Your mercy, to make me among those mentioned in Your book and described in Your tablets. Have You ordained for me, O my God, after this sorrow, any joy, after this constriction, any expansion, and after this hardship, any ease? Ah, ah, You made the pulpits for Your mention and the exaltation of Your word and the manifestation of Your Cause, and I ascended them to exalt the breach of Your covenant and cast upon the servants what made the inhabitants of the pavilion of Your greatness and the inhabitants of the cities of Your knowledge wail.</p>
<p>How many times did You send down the table of Your revelation from the sky of Your bounty, and I disbelieved in it, and how many times did You invite me to the Euphrates of Your mercy, and I turned away from it following my self and desires. By Your might, I do not know from which sin to seek Your forgiveness and repent to You, and from which injustice to return to the court of Your bounty and the field of Your generosity. My transgressions and sins have reached a station that the enumerators cannot count and the writers cannot inscribe.</p>
<p>I ask You, O transformer of darkness into light and revealer of mysteries in the mount, to assist me in all conditions to rely on You and entrust matters to You. Then make me, O my God, content with what the Pen of Your decree has inscribed and the Pen of Your predestination has written. You are the Omnipotent over what You will, and in Your grasp is the reins of those in the heavens and the earths. There is no god but You, the All-Knowing, the Wise.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-the-sheikh">To the Sheikh</h2>
<p>O Sheikh, know that the slander, opposition, and objections of the people do not harm the one who clings to the cord of divine favor and grasps the hem of the mercy of the Lord of creation. By the life of God, the Baha did not speak from desire; He was made to speak by the One who has made all things speak by His remembrance and praise. There is no god but Him, the Unique, the Omnipotent, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Those who possess keen sight, attentive ears, enlightened hearts, and expanded chests recognize truth from falsehood and distinguish it. Read this supplication that has flowed from the tongue of the oppressed, and reflect upon it with a serene heart and a purified, holy ear. Perhaps you will find the breezes of detachment and show mercy to yourselves and to the servants of God.</p>
<section id="a-supplication-to-read" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-supplication-to-read">A Supplication to Read</h3>
<p>“O God, O worshiped one, O sought one, O generous, O merciful, lives are from You and powers are within the grasp of Your might. Whomever You exalt will transcend the world and reach the station of”We raised him to a lofty station,” and whomever You cast down will be lower than dust, indeed, nothing can be better than him. O Lord, with corruption, sinfulness, and lack of piety, we seek the seat of truth and yearn for the meeting with Your chosen ones. The command is Yours, the decree is Yours, and the realm of power is under Your control. Whatever You do is pure justice, nay, it is sheer grace. One manifestation of Your name, the Merciful, can eradicate the traces of disobedience from the world and obliterate them. One breeze from the breezes of the Day of Your Manifestation can adorn the world with a new robe.</p>
<p>O powerful one, grant power to the powerless and life to the dead, that they may find You and reach the ocean of Your knowledge and remain steadfast in Your command. If the languages of the world extol Your praise, whether in Arabic or Persian, it is the beloved of the soul and the aim of the spirit. If they are deprived of it, they are not worthy of mention, whether words or meanings. O Lord, I beseech You to guide all and lead them aright. You are the capable, the mighty, the knowledgeable, and the seeing. We ask Allah to aid you in justice and fairness and to make known to you what was hidden from eyes and visions. He is the mighty, the chosen one.”</p>
<p>I request that they reflect upon what has been revealed and speak with justice and fairness. Perhaps the manifestations of the lights of the sun of truth and purity will shine forth and save from the darkness of ignorance, and illuminate the world with the light of knowledge. This oppressed one did not attend schools nor see discussions. By my life, I did not manifest myself; rather, Allah manifested me as He willed. In the Tablet to the Sultan, may Allah strengthen him, these words flowed from the tongue of the oppressed.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-tablet-to-the-sultan">From the Tablet to the Sultan</h3>
<p>O Sultan, I was like one of the servants, resting on my bed. The breezes of the All-Glorious passed over me and taught me the knowledge of what was. This is not from me but from the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He commanded me to proclaim between earth and heaven, and thus came upon me what brought tears to the eyes of the knowers. I did not read what the people possess of knowledge, nor did I enter schools. Ask the city where I was so that you may be certain that I am not one of the liars.</p>
<p>This is a leaf moved by the winds of the will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Does it have any stability when the strong winds blow? No, by the Lord of names and attributes, it moves as He wills. Non-existence has no existence before eternity. His irrevocable command has come, and He made me speak of His remembrance among the people. I was nothing but like a dead one before His command. The hand of the will of your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate, turned me.</p>
<p>It is better for you to purify yourself with the water of detachment that flows from the spring of the Most High Pen, and for the sake of Allah, reflect on what has been revealed before and after, and strive with wisdom and utterance to extinguish the fire of hatred and enmity hidden in the hearts of the world’s parties as much as possible.</p>
<p>The purpose of sending the messengers and revealing the books has been to know Allah and to foster affection and unity among His servants. Now, it is observed that the divine law has been made a cause of hatred and enmity. Alas, what regret that most are clinging to what they possess and are heedless and veiled from what is with Allah.</p>
<p>Say, “O my God, my God, adorn my head with the crown of justice and my body with the garment of fairness. Verily, You are the Possessor of gifts and favors.” Justice and fairness are two guardians for the preservation of the servants, and from these two words, strong and blessed, the cause of the world’s well-being and the preservation of nations will appear.</p>
<p>In one of the Tablets, these words flowed from the Pen of the Oppressed: “Verily, the Exalted One has created the essence of meanings from the human essence, that is, the Dawning-places of His Cause and the repositories of the jewels of His knowledge, for He is a hidden mystery, concealed from all eyes.” Look at what the Merciful has revealed in the Quran: “No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision; He is the Subtle, the Aware.”</p>
<p>Today, the religion of God and His path is that the diverse religions and various ways should not become a cause of hatred and enmity among the people. These solid principles and strong laws have appeared from one source and have risen from one dawn. These differences were due to the requirements of time and circumstances and the eras and ages.</p>
<p>O people of Baha, gird up the loins of endeavor that religious strife and contention may be removed from among the people of the world and be extinguished for the sake of Allah and His servants. Arise for this mighty and significant matter. Religious hatred and enmity is a world-consuming fire, and its extinction is exceedingly difficult except by the power of the Hand of God. He can save the people from this grievous calamity.</p>
<p>Consider the warfare between two governments; both sides sacrificed their wealth and lives. How many villages became as though they had never existed! This word is as a lamp for the lampstand of the Bayan.</p>
<p>O people of the world, you are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch. Walk with utmost love, unity, friendliness, and concord. By the Sun of Truth, the light of unity will brighten and illuminate the horizons. God is the witness and has been the witness of this utterance. Strive to attain this high and exalted station, which is the protection and preservation of the human world. This is the intent of the sovereign of goals and the hope of the king of desires. But until the sun of justice emerges from the dark cloud of oppression, the appearance of this high and exalted station seems difficult. The dark cloud is the manifestations of doubts and superstitions, namely the clerics of Iran.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have spoken with the tongue of law, and sometimes with the tongue of truth and way. The ultimate goal and supreme objective have been the appearance of this high and exalted station. God is sufficient as a witness.</p>
<p>O people of Baha, associate with all the people of the world with joy and fragrance. If you possess a word or a jewel that others are deprived of, convey it with the language of love and kindness. If it is accepted and has an effect, the goal is achieved; otherwise, leave them to themselves and pray for them, not harm them.</p>
<p>The tongue of kindness attracts hearts, is the sustenance of the soul, and is like meanings for words and like the horizon for the rising sun of wisdom and knowledge. The intended meaning of scholars in these contexts refers to those who outwardly adorn themselves with the garb of knowledge but are inwardly deprived of it.</p>
<p>In mentioning this station in the Tablet to the Sultan, a few phrases from the Hidden Words, named the Scroll of Fatimah, peace be upon her, revealed from the Most Glorious Pen are mentioned.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-hidden-words">From the Hidden Words</h3>
<p>[O faithless ones!] Why do you outwardly claim to be shepherds, yet inwardly become wolves to My sheep? Your example is like a star before dawn that appears luminous and bright, but inwardly is a cause of misguidance and the destruction of the caravans of My city and lands. And likewise, He says:</p>
<p>[O outwardly adorned and inwardly diminished!] Your example is like pure bitter water, which appears perfectly clear and pure, but when it falls into the hands of the divine taster, He would not accept even a drop of it. The manifestation of the sun in both dust and mirror is present, but there is a difference from the Pleiades to the earth, rather an infinite difference between them. And likewise, He says:</p>
<p>[O son of the world!] Many a dawn My favor’s effulgence shone from the horizon of the placeless onto your place, and found you preoccupied in the bed of ease with other than Me, and like a spiritual flash returned to the luminous station of honor, and I did not announce your shame in the abodes of proximity before the armies of holiness. And likewise, He says:</p>
<p>[O claimant of My love!] At dawn, the breeze of My favor passed over you and found you sleeping on the bed of heedlessness, wept over your state, and returned. However, those scholars who are truly adorned with the ornament of knowledge and character are like the head to the body of the world and like the eyes to the nations. The guidance of the servants has always been through these holy souls and still is. We ask God to enable them to do what He loves and is pleased with. He is the Master of all and the Lord of the hereafter and the here and now.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sheikh-commanded-the-killing-of-the-servants">The Sheikh Commanded the Killing of the Servants</h3>
<p>O Sheikh, we have heard that you have turned away from us and opposed us, commanding the people to curse me and issuing a decree for the shedding of the blood of the servants. May the one who said it be praised:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Willingly for a judge who came in his judgment, surprisingly He issued a fatwa for my blood to be shed in the sanctuary and the forbidden.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly I say, whatever enters the path of God is beloved to the soul and the aim of the spirit. The deadly poison on His path is a supreme honey, and His torment is a fitting sweetness. It is mentioned in the Tablet to the Sultan, and by the truth itself, I do not dread calamities in His path nor hardships in His love. God has made affliction the morning breeze for this verdant garden and the wick for His lamp, by which the earth and heaven have been illumined.</p>
<p>Turn your heart towards the direction of the Kaaba of God, the Overseeing, the Self-Subsisting. Then raise your hands in steadfastness, so that the hands of all possible beings may be raised to the heaven of the grace of God, the Lord of the worlds. Then direct yourself to Him with a focus by which all beings will turn to His radiant horizon, and say:</p>
<p>“O Lord, I see myself turning towards the heaven of Your bounty and the ocean of Your grace, and turning away from anything other than You. I ask You by the manifestations of the luminary of Your revelation on the Mount and by the radiations of the sun of Your grace from the horizon of Your name, the Forgiving, to forgive me and have mercy upon me. Then inscribe for me from Your supreme Pen what elevates me with Your name in the human realm of creation. O Lord, enable me to turn to You and to heed the call of Your friends, who were not weakened by the power of the world, nor hindered by the might of the nations. They came forward and said, ‘God is our Lord and the Lord of those in the heavens and the earths.’”</p>
<p>O Sheikh, truly I say, the seal of the sealed choice wine, named the Self-Subsisting, has been lifted; do not deprive yourself. This oppressed one speaks for the sake of God; you also, for the sake of God, reflect on what has been revealed and made manifest. Perhaps you may partake of the outpourings of the True Bestower on this blessed day and not remain deprived. This is not difficult for God. The earthly man became celestial through the divine word, and the fisherman acquired divine wisdom. Abu Dhar, the shepherd of sheep, became the chief of the nations.</p>
<p>O Sheikh, today is not the day for the outward sciences and arts, for it has been observed that a person who is not aware of even a word of those sciences is seated on the throne of command in the assembly of knowledge, while those with sciences and skills are deprived. The sciences intended here are those that begin and end with words. However, the sciences that show effect and produce fruit and are a cause of comfort and ease for the servants of God are accepted by Him and always have been. If you hear my call, you will leave what you have and turn towards the station where the sea of wisdom and expression surges, and the fragrance of the grace of your Lord, the Merciful, wafts.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bahaullahs-story-regarding-the-assassination-attempt-on-the-sultan">Baha’u’llah’s Story Regarding the Assassination Attempt on the Sultan</h3>
<p>In this station, it seemed appropriate to mention some past events, perhaps they might lead to the appearance of justice and fairness. During the days when His Majesty the Sultan, may Allah, the Merciful, aid him, intended to travel to Isfahan, I obtained permission and set out to visit the sacred and illuminated shrines of the Imams, peace be upon them. After returning, due to the heat of the capital and its severe conditions, we went to Bulaq. After this journey, the incident with His Majesty the Sultan occurred, and during those days, matters were turned upside down, and the fire of anger was kindled. Some people were arrested, including this oppressed one.</p>
<p>By the life of God, I was never involved in that reprehensible matter, and even in the investigation assemblies, my innocence was established. Despite this, they arrested me and from Niavaran, which at that time was the seat of the government, they took me bareheaded and barefoot, walking with chains to the prison in Tehran. A tyrant on horseback accompanied me, taking off his hat with all speed, and with a group of executioners and soldiers, they took me, and in the place that had no equal, they confined me.</p>
<p>But the prison where this oppressed one and other oppressed ones were held was truly a narrow, dark dungeon, and better than that. When we entered the prison, after entering, they put us in a dark corridor; from there we descended three steps to the place they had assigned. But the place was dark, and about one hundred and fifty people were present there, thieves and murderers, and highway robbers. With such a crowd, the place had no ventilation except for the entrance by which we entered. Words fail to describe it, and the stench is beyond expression. Most of the inmates were without clothes or bedding. God knows what befell us in that foul, dark place.</p>
<p>During the days and nights in that prison, I reflected on the actions and behaviors of the Babi group. Despite their exalted station and high understanding, how did such actions appear from them, namely, the insolence and movement of that group against the royal personage? After this, this oppressed one resolved that after leaving the prison, he would strive with all his might to reform those souls. One night, in a vision, this sublime word was heard from all directions: “We shall assist you with yourself and with your pen; do not grieve over what has befallen you, nor fear, for you are among the secure. Soon, God will raise up the treasures of the earth—they are men who will help you with yourself and with your name, by which God has quickened the hearts of the knowers.”</p>
<p>After leaving the prison, by the command of His Majesty the Shah, may Allah guard him, with the servant of the Sublime State of Iran and the gracious government of Russia, we set out for Iraq. After arriving, with the aid of God and His grace and mercy, verses like a downpour of rain were revealed and sent to all parts of the earth. We counseled all the servants, especially this group, with wise admonitions and compassionate advice, and prevented them from corruption, strife, conflict, and warfare. By the grace of God, heedlessness and ignorance were transformed into piety and knowledge, and weapons into means of reformation.</p>
<p>During the days of imprisonment in the land of Ta, although sleep was scarce due to the chains and the foul odors, at times when it was possible, it felt as if something was being poured from the top of the head, like a great river flowing from the peak of a lofty mountain to the ground. In those moments, the tongue would recite what no one could bear to hear. Some of the statements revealed in specific Tablets for this group are mentioned to ensure that all know with clear certainty that this oppressed one has acted upon what is loved and accepted by the wise and the manifestations of justice and fairness.</p>
<p>O friends of God in His lands and beloved ones in His cities, the oppressed one advises you to honesty and piety. Blessed is the city that attains their lights; through them, the station of humanity is elevated, and the door of tranquility is opened to those in existence. Blessed is the one who holds fast to them and recognizes their station, and woe to the one who denies their rank.</p>
