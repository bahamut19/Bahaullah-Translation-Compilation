<p>In the name of Allah, the Unique, the One, the Omnipotent, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>Praise be to Allah, the Eternal, the Everlasting, the Standing without change, the Dominant by His sovereignty, the Manifest by His signs, and the Hidden by His mysteries. By His command, the banner of the supreme word was raised in the human realm of creation, and He established the standard of “He does what He wills” among the people.</p>
<p>He is the One who revealed His command to guide His creation and sent down His verses to manifest His proof and evidence. He adorned the page of the Book of Man with His revelation, saying: “The Most Merciful taught the Quran, created man, and taught him eloquence.” There is no god but Him, the Unique, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>He is the radiant light from the horizon of the sky of generosity and the shining sun from the dawn of the will of Allah, the Sovereign of the kingdom of names. Upon the great intermediary and the supreme pen, which Allah has made the source of His most beautiful names and the dawn of His highest attributes. Through Him, the light of oneness shone from the horizon of the world, and the rule of singularity was established among the nations who turned with radiant faces to the highest horizon and acknowledged what the tongue of revelation proclaimed in the realm of understanding. The dominion and the kingdom, the grandeur and the power, belong to Allah, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Bountiful.</p>

<p>O noble scholar, heed the call of the oppressed. He advises you for the sake of Allah and admonishes you with what brings you closer to Him in all conditions. He is the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Know that ears were created to listen to the call on this day, which was mentioned in the books, scriptures, and tablets.</p>
<p>First, purify yourself with the water of detachment and adorn your head with the crown of piety, and your body with the garment of reliance on Allah. Then arise from your place, turning towards the Greatest House, the circumambulation site for those in the world from the Everlasting Sovereign.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-prayer-for-the-scholar-to-say-to-god">A Prayer for the Scholar to Say to God</h3>
<p>Say: “O my God, my God, my goal, my adored one, my lord, my support, the utmost of my hope and my aspiration, I see myself turning towards You, clinging to the cord of Your bounty, holding fast to the hem of Your grace, and acknowledging the sanctity of Your Essence and the purity of Your Being, affirming Your oneness and singleness. I bear witness that You are the Unique, the One, the Eternal. You have no partner in Your dominion, nor a peer on the earth. The beings have testified to what the tongue of Your majesty has testified before them, that You are Allah, there is no god but You. You have always been sanctified beyond the mention of Your servants and exalted above the description of Your creatures.</p>
<p>O Lord, You see the ignorant one approaching the sea of Your knowledge, the thirsty one desiring the fountain of Your utterance, the lowly one seeking the shelter of Your might, the poor one seeking the treasure of Your wealth, the beggar seeking the dawn of Your wisdom, the weak one seeking the rise of Your power, the needy one seeking the sky of Your generosity, and the worn-out one seeking the kingdom of Your mention. I testify, O my God and my Sovereign, that You created me for Your remembrance and praise and to assist Your Cause, and indeed, I have supported Your enemies who broke Your covenant, discarded Your book, and disbelieved in You and Your signs. Ah, ah, from my heedlessness and my shame, my sin, and my guilt which prevented me from entering the mighty sea of Your oneness and the vast ocean of Your mercy. Ah, ah, then ah, ah from my wretched state and my great disobedience. You have revealed me, O my God, to exalt Your word and manifest Your Cause, but my heedlessness has prevented me and surrounded me to the extent that I rose to erase Your traces and shed the blood of Your chosen ones and the dawns of Your signs, the sources of Your revelation, and the treasures of Your mysteries.</p>
<p>O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, I testify that by my injustice the fruits of the tree of Your justice fell, and by the fire of my disobedience, the hearts of the near ones among Your creation burned, and the livers of the sincere ones among Your servants melted. Ah, ah from my misery, ah, ah from my injustice, ah, ah from my remoteness, my heedlessness, my ignorance, my humiliation, my turning away, and my opposition. How many days have You commanded Your servants and friends to preserve me, and I commanded them to harm You and Your trustees. How many nights have You reminded me of Your grace and guided me to Your path, and I turned away from You and Your signs. By Your might, O hope of the monotheists and the aspiration of the hearts of the detached ones, I find no helper for myself but You, nor any other sovereign besides You, nor any refuge or shelter. Ah, ah, my turning away burned the veil of my chastity, and my opposition tore the curtain of my sanctity. I wish I had been under layers of dust and my evil deeds had not appeared among Your servants.</p>
<p>O Lord, You see the sinner turning to the dawning place of Your forgiveness and bounty, and the mountain of injustice seeking the sky of Your mercy and pardon. Ah, ah, my great transgressions prevented me from approaching the court of Your mercy, and my major sins distanced me from the vicinity of Your closeness. I am the one who neglected Your right, broke Your covenant and Your pact, and committed what made the inhabitants of the cities of Your justice and the dawns of Your grace in Your lands lament. I testify, O my God, that I abandoned Your commands and followed my own commands, discarded the judgments of Your book, and took the book of my desires. Ah, ah, whenever my misery increased, Your forbearance increased, and whenever the fire of my disobedience blazed, Your forgiveness and grace covered it. By Your might, O desired one of the world and beloved of the nations, Your patience deceived me, and Your endurance encouraged me. You see, O my God, my tears from my shame and my sighs from my heedlessness. By Your greatness, I find no place for myself except the shadow of the canopy of Your generosity, nor any escape but under the domes of Your mercy. You see me in the sea of despair and hopelessness after You made me hear the word “Do not despair.” By Your might, my injustice severed the cord of my hope, and my disobedience blackened my face before the throne of Your justice.</p>
<p>O Lord, You see the dead one lying before the gate of Your bounty and feeling ashamed to ask for the fountain of Your forgiveness from the hand of Your grace. You have given me a tongue for Your remembrance and praise, and it spoke what melted the livers of the near ones among Your chosen ones and burned the hearts of the sincere ones among the inhabitants of Your holy sanctuaries. You have given me sight to behold Your traces, observe Your signs, and the manifestations of Your craftsmanship, and I disregarded Your will and did what made the sincere ones among Your creation and the detached ones among Your servants wail. You gave me hearing to hear Your remembrance and praise and what You revealed from the sky of Your generosity and the air of Your will. Ah, ah, I abandoned Your command and commanded Your servants to curse Your trustees and friends, and I did before the throne of Your justice what caused the sighs of the monotheists and the sincere ones among the inhabitants of Your kingdom to rise.</p>
<p>I do not know, O my God, which of my sins to mention before the waves of the ocean of Your bounty, and which of my transgressions to speak of before the manifestations of the lights of the suns of Your favors and kindnesses. I ask You at this moment, by the secrets of Your book and what was hidden in Your knowledge, and by the pearls hidden in the shells of the oceans of Your mercy, to make me among those mentioned in Your book and described in Your tablets. Have You ordained for me, O my God, after this sorrow, any joy, after this constriction, any expansion, and after this hardship, any ease? Ah, ah, You made the pulpits for Your mention and the exaltation of Your word and the manifestation of Your Cause, and I ascended them to exalt the breach of Your covenant and cast upon the servants what made the inhabitants of the pavilion of Your greatness and the inhabitants of the cities of Your knowledge wail.</p>
<p>How many times did You send down the table of Your revelation from the sky of Your bounty, and I disbelieved in it, and how many times did You invite me to the Euphrates of Your mercy, and I turned away from it following my self and desires. By Your might, I do not know from which sin to seek Your forgiveness and repent to You, and from which injustice to return to the court of Your bounty and the field of Your generosity. My transgressions and sins have reached a station that the enumerators cannot count and the writers cannot inscribe.</p>
<p>I ask You, O transformer of darkness into light and revealer of mysteries in the mount, to assist me in all conditions to rely on You and entrust matters to You. Then make me, O my God, content with what the Pen of Your decree has inscribed and the Pen of Your predestination has written. You are the Omnipotent over what You will, and in Your grasp is the reins of those in the heavens and the earths. There is no god but You, the All-Knowing, the Wise.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="to-the-sheikh">To the Sheikh</h2>
<p>O Sheikh, know that the slander, opposition, and objections of the people do not harm the one who clings to the cord of divine favor and grasps the hem of the mercy of the Lord of creation. By the life of God, the Baha did not speak from desire; He was made to speak by the One who has made all things speak by His remembrance and praise. There is no god but Him, the Unique, the Omnipotent, the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Those who possess keen sight, attentive ears, enlightened hearts, and expanded chests recognize truth from falsehood and distinguish it. Read this supplication that has flowed from the tongue of the oppressed, and reflect upon it with a serene heart and a purified, holy ear. Perhaps you will find the breezes of detachment and show mercy to yourselves and to the servants of God.</p>
<section id="a-supplication-to-read" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-supplication-to-read">A Supplication to Read</h3>
<p>“O God, O worshiped one, O sought one, O generous, O merciful, lives are from You and powers are within the grasp of Your might. Whomever You exalt will transcend the world and reach the station of”We raised him to a lofty station,” and whomever You cast down will be lower than dust, indeed, nothing can be better than him. O Lord, with corruption, sinfulness, and lack of piety, we seek the seat of truth and yearn for the meeting with Your chosen ones. The command is Yours, the decree is Yours, and the realm of power is under Your control. Whatever You do is pure justice, nay, it is sheer grace. One manifestation of Your name, the Merciful, can eradicate the traces of disobedience from the world and obliterate them. One breeze from the breezes of the Day of Your Manifestation can adorn the world with a new robe.</p>
<p>O powerful one, grant power to the powerless and life to the dead, that they may find You and reach the ocean of Your knowledge and remain steadfast in Your command. If the languages of the world extol Your praise, whether in Arabic or Persian, it is the beloved of the soul and the aim of the spirit. If they are deprived of it, they are not worthy of mention, whether words or meanings. O Lord, I beseech You to guide all and lead them aright. You are the capable, the mighty, the knowledgeable, and the seeing. We ask Allah to aid you in justice and fairness and to make known to you what was hidden from eyes and visions. He is the mighty, the chosen one.”</p>
<p>I request that they reflect upon what has been revealed and speak with justice and fairness. Perhaps the manifestations of the lights of the sun of truth and purity will shine forth and save from the darkness of ignorance, and illuminate the world with the light of knowledge. This oppressed one did not attend schools nor see discussions. By my life, I did not manifest myself; rather, Allah manifested me as He willed. In the Tablet to the Sultan, may Allah strengthen him, these words flowed from the tongue of the oppressed.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-the-tablet-to-the-sultan" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-tablet-to-the-sultan">From the Tablet to the Sultan</h3>
<p>O Sultan, I was like one of the servants, resting on my bed. The breezes of the All-Glorious passed over me and taught me the knowledge of what was. This is not from me but from the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He commanded me to proclaim between earth and heaven, and thus came upon me what brought tears to the eyes of the knowers. I did not read what the people possess of knowledge, nor did I enter schools. Ask the city where I was so that you may be certain that I am not one of the liars.</p>
<p>This is a leaf moved by the winds of the will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Does it have any stability when the strong winds blow? No, by the Lord of names and attributes, it moves as He wills. Non-existence has no existence before eternity. His irrevocable command has come, and He made me speak of His remembrance among the people. I was nothing but like a dead one before His command. The hand of the will of your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate, turned me.</p>
<p>It is better for you to purify yourself with the water of detachment that flows from the spring of the Most High Pen, and for the sake of Allah, reflect on what has been revealed before and after, and strive with wisdom and utterance to extinguish the fire of hatred and enmity hidden in the hearts of the world’s parties as much as possible.</p>
<p>The purpose of sending the messengers and revealing the books has been to know Allah and to foster affection and unity among His servants. Now, it is observed that the divine law has been made a cause of hatred and enmity. Alas, what regret that most are clinging to what they possess and are heedless and veiled from what is with Allah.</p>
<p>Say, “O my God, my God, adorn my head with the crown of justice and my body with the garment of fairness. Verily, You are the Possessor of gifts and favors.” Justice and fairness are two guardians for the preservation of the servants, and from these two words, strong and blessed, the cause of the world’s well-being and the preservation of nations will appear.</p>
<p>In one of the Tablets, these words flowed from the Pen of the Oppressed: “Verily, the Exalted One has created the essence of meanings from the human essence, that is, the Dawning-places of His Cause and the repositories of the jewels of His knowledge, for He is a hidden mystery, concealed from all eyes.” Look at what the Merciful has revealed in the Quran: “No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision; He is the Subtle, the Aware.”</p>
<p>Today, the religion of God and His path is that the diverse religions and various ways should not become a cause of hatred and enmity among the people. These solid principles and strong laws have appeared from one source and have risen from one dawn. These differences were due to the requirements of time and circumstances and the eras and ages.</p>
<p>O people of Baha, gird up the loins of endeavor that religious strife and contention may be removed from among the people of the world and be extinguished for the sake of Allah and His servants. Arise for this mighty and significant matter. Religious hatred and enmity is a world-consuming fire, and its extinction is exceedingly difficult except by the power of the Hand of God. He can save the people from this grievous calamity.</p>
<p>Consider the warfare between two governments; both sides sacrificed their wealth and lives. How many villages became as though they had never existed! This word is as a lamp for the lampstand of the Bayan.</p>
<p>O people of the world, you are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch. Walk with utmost love, unity, friendliness, and concord. By the Sun of Truth, the light of unity will brighten and illuminate the horizons. God is the witness and has been the witness of this utterance. Strive to attain this high and exalted station, which is the protection and preservation of the human world. This is the intent of the sovereign of goals and the hope of the king of desires. But until the sun of justice emerges from the dark cloud of oppression, the appearance of this high and exalted station seems difficult. The dark cloud is the manifestations of doubts and superstitions, namely the clerics of Iran.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have spoken with the tongue of law, and sometimes with the tongue of truth and way. The ultimate goal and supreme objective have been the appearance of this high and exalted station. God is sufficient as a witness.</p>
<p>O people of Baha, associate with all the people of the world with joy and fragrance. If you possess a word or a jewel that others are deprived of, convey it with the language of love and kindness. If it is accepted and has an effect, the goal is achieved; otherwise, leave them to themselves and pray for them, not harm them.</p>
<p>The tongue of kindness attracts hearts, is the sustenance of the soul, and is like meanings for words and like the horizon for the rising sun of wisdom and knowledge. The intended meaning of scholars in these contexts refers to those who outwardly adorn themselves with the garb of knowledge but are inwardly deprived of it.</p>
<p>In mentioning this station in the Tablet to the Sultan, a few phrases from the Hidden Words, named the Scroll of Fatimah, peace be upon her, revealed from the Most Glorious Pen are mentioned.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-the-hidden-words" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-hidden-words">From the Hidden Words</h3>
<p>[O faithless ones!] Why do you outwardly claim to be shepherds, yet inwardly become wolves to My sheep? Your example is like a star before dawn that appears luminous and bright, but inwardly is a cause of misguidance and the destruction of the caravans of My city and lands. And likewise, He says:</p>
<p>[O outwardly adorned and inwardly diminished!] Your example is like pure bitter water, which appears perfectly clear and pure, but when it falls into the hands of the divine taster, He would not accept even a drop of it. The manifestation of the sun in both dust and mirror is present, but there is a difference from the Pleiades to the earth, rather an infinite difference between them. And likewise, He says:</p>
<p>[O son of the world!] Many a dawn My favor’s effulgence shone from the horizon of the placeless onto your place, and found you preoccupied in the bed of ease with other than Me, and like a spiritual flash returned to the luminous station of honor, and I did not announce your shame in the abodes of proximity before the armies of holiness. And likewise, He says:</p>
<p>[O claimant of My love!] At dawn, the breeze of My favor passed over you and found you sleeping on the bed of heedlessness, wept over your state, and returned. However, those scholars who are truly adorned with the ornament of knowledge and character are like the head to the body of the world and like the eyes to the nations. The guidance of the servants has always been through these holy souls and still is. We ask God to enable them to do what He loves and is pleased with. He is the Master of all and the Lord of the hereafter and the here and now.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sheikh-commanded-the-killing-of-the-servants">The Sheikh Commanded the Killing of the Servants</h3>
<p>O Sheikh, we have heard that you have turned away from us and opposed us, commanding the people to curse me and issuing a decree for the shedding of the blood of the servants. May the one who said it be praised:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Willingly for a judge who came in his judgment, surprisingly He issued a fatwa for my blood to be shed in the sanctuary and the forbidden.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly I say, whatever enters the path of God is beloved to the soul and the aim of the spirit. The deadly poison on His path is a supreme honey, and His torment is a fitting sweetness. It is mentioned in the Tablet to the Sultan, and by the truth itself, I do not dread calamities in His path nor hardships in His love. God has made affliction the morning breeze for this verdant garden and the wick for His lamp, by which the earth and heaven have been illumined.</p>
<p>Turn your heart towards the direction of the Kaaba of God, the Overseeing, the Self-Subsisting. Then raise your hands in steadfastness, so that the hands of all possible beings may be raised to the heaven of the grace of God, the Lord of the worlds. Then direct yourself to Him with a focus by which all beings will turn to His radiant horizon, and say:</p>
<p>“O Lord, I see myself turning towards the heaven of Your bounty and the ocean of Your grace, and turning away from anything other than You. I ask You by the manifestations of the luminary of Your revelation on the Mount and by the radiations of the sun of Your grace from the horizon of Your name, the Forgiving, to forgive me and have mercy upon me. Then inscribe for me from Your supreme Pen what elevates me with Your name in the human realm of creation. O Lord, enable me to turn to You and to heed the call of Your friends, who were not weakened by the power of the world, nor hindered by the might of the nations. They came forward and said, ‘God is our Lord and the Lord of those in the heavens and the earths.’”</p>
<p>O Sheikh, truly I say, the seal of the sealed choice wine, named the Self-Subsisting, has been lifted; do not deprive yourself. This oppressed one speaks for the sake of God; you also, for the sake of God, reflect on what has been revealed and made manifest. Perhaps you may partake of the outpourings of the True Bestower on this blessed day and not remain deprived. This is not difficult for God. The earthly man became celestial through the divine word, and the fisherman acquired divine wisdom. Abu Dhar, the shepherd of sheep, became the chief of the nations.</p>
<p>O Sheikh, today is not the day for the outward sciences and arts, for it has been observed that a person who is not aware of even a word of those sciences is seated on the throne of command in the assembly of knowledge, while those with sciences and skills are deprived. The sciences intended here are those that begin and end with words. However, the sciences that show effect and produce fruit and are a cause of comfort and ease for the servants of God are accepted by Him and always have been. If you hear my call, you will leave what you have and turn towards the station where the sea of wisdom and expression surges, and the fragrance of the grace of your Lord, the Merciful, wafts.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bahaullahs-story-regarding-the-assassination-attempt-on-the-sultan">Baha’u’llah’s Story Regarding the Assassination Attempt on the Sultan</h3>
<p>In this station, it seemed appropriate to mention some past events, perhaps they might lead to the appearance of justice and fairness. During the days when His Majesty the Sultan, may Allah, the Merciful, aid him, intended to travel to Isfahan, I obtained permission and set out to visit the sacred and illuminated shrines of the Imams, peace be upon them. After returning, due to the heat of the capital and its severe conditions, we went to Bulaq. After this journey, the incident with His Majesty the Sultan occurred, and during those days, matters were turned upside down, and the fire of anger was kindled. Some people were arrested, including this oppressed one.</p>
<p>By the life of God, I was never involved in that reprehensible matter, and even in the investigation assemblies, my innocence was established. Despite this, they arrested me and from Niavaran, which at that time was the seat of the government, they took me bareheaded and barefoot, walking with chains to the prison in Tehran. A tyrant on horseback accompanied me, taking off his hat with all speed, and with a group of executioners and soldiers, they took me, and in the place that had no equal, they confined me.</p>
<p>But the prison where this oppressed one and other oppressed ones were held was truly a narrow, dark dungeon, and better than that. When we entered the prison, after entering, they put us in a dark corridor; from there we descended three steps to the place they had assigned. But the place was dark, and about one hundred and fifty people were present there, thieves and murderers, and highway robbers. With such a crowd, the place had no ventilation except for the entrance by which we entered. Words fail to describe it, and the stench is beyond expression. Most of the inmates were without clothes or bedding. God knows what befell us in that foul, dark place.</p>
<p>During the days and nights in that prison, I reflected on the actions and behaviors of the Babi group. Despite their exalted station and high understanding, how did such actions appear from them, namely, the insolence and movement of that group against the royal personage? After this, this oppressed one resolved that after leaving the prison, he would strive with all his might to reform those souls. One night, in a vision, this sublime word was heard from all directions: “We shall assist you with yourself and with your pen; do not grieve over what has befallen you, nor fear, for you are among the secure. Soon, God will raise up the treasures of the earth—they are men who will help you with yourself and with your name, by which God has quickened the hearts of the knowers.”</p>
<p>After leaving the prison, by the command of His Majesty the Shah, may Allah guard him, with the servant of the Sublime State of Iran and the gracious government of Russia, we set out for Iraq. After arriving, with the aid of God and His grace and mercy, verses like a downpour of rain were revealed and sent to all parts of the earth. We counseled all the servants, especially this group, with wise admonitions and compassionate advice, and prevented them from corruption, strife, conflict, and warfare. By the grace of God, heedlessness and ignorance were transformed into piety and knowledge, and weapons into means of reformation.</p>
<p>During the days of imprisonment in the land of Ta, although sleep was scarce due to the chains and the foul odors, at times when it was possible, it felt as if something was being poured from the top of the head, like a great river flowing from the peak of a lofty mountain to the ground. In those moments, the tongue would recite what no one could bear to hear. Some of the statements revealed in specific Tablets for this group are mentioned to ensure that all know with clear certainty that this oppressed one has acted upon what is loved and accepted by the wise and the manifestations of justice and fairness.</p>
<p>O friends of God in His lands and beloved ones in His cities, the oppressed one advises you to honesty and piety. Blessed is the city that attains their lights; through them, the station of humanity is elevated, and the door of tranquility is opened to those in existence. Blessed is the one who holds fast to them and recognizes their station, and woe to the one who denies their rank.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-other-tablets" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-other-tablets">From Other Tablets</h3>
<p>And in another place, these words were revealed: We command the servants of God and His maidservants to purity and piety, that they may rise from the sleep of desire and turn to God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Thus did we command the servants when the Luminary of the horizons shone from the direction of Iraq. It is not the harm of my imprisonment and afflictions, nor what has come upon me from the tyrants among the servants, but the deeds of those who attribute themselves to me and commit acts that cause my heart and pen to lament. Verily, those who spread corruption on earth, misappropriate people’s wealth, and enter houses without the permission of their owners, I am innocent of them unless they repent and return to God, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>And in another place: O assembly of the earth, hasten to the pleasure of God and strive with true striving in manifesting His irrevocable and mighty Cause. We have ordained striving in the path of God with the armies of wisdom and utterance, and with morals and deeds. Thus has the matter been decreed from One Mighty, Powerful. Pride is not for those who cause corruption on earth after it has been set right. Fear God, O people, and do not be of the wrongdoers.</p>
<p>And in another place: Do not curse anyone among you. We have come for the unification of those on earth and their harmony. This is testified by what has appeared from the ocean of my utterance among the servants, but most of the people are in clear remoteness. If someone curses you or inflicts harm upon you in the path of God, be patient and rely on the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He witnesses and sees, and does what He wills with authority from Himself. Verily, He is the Omnipotent, the Mighty. You have been forbidden from dispute and contention in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Great. Hold fast to what benefits your souls and the people of the world. Thus does the Eternal Sovereign, manifest with the Most Great Name, command you. Verily, He is the Wise Commander.</p>
<p>And in another place: Beware that you do not shed blood. Unsheathe the sword of the tongue from the scabbard of speech, for by it are the cities of hearts conquered. We have abolished the law of killing among you. Verily, mercy has preceded all that is possible if you are of those who know.</p>
<p>And in another place: O people, do not corrupt the earth, do not shed blood, do not consume people’s wealth wrongfully, and do not follow every accursed and rejected clamor.</p>
<p>And in another place: The sun of God’s utterance does not set and does not follow disappearance. Today this sublime word was heard from the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary: Verily, to those who love me and follow my commands and abandon what is forbidden in my Book.</p>
<p>And in another place: Today is the day of remembrance and praise, the day of service. Do not deprive yourselves. You are the letters of words and the words of the Book, and you are the saplings planted by the hand of favor in the land of mercy and have grown from the rains of grace. You have been preserved from the storms of polytheism and the blasts of disbelief and have been nurtured with the hands of kindness. Now is the time for fruits and leaves, and the fruits of the human tree are good deeds and pleasing morals. These fruits should be withheld from the heedless. If they accept, the goal is achieved, and life is made manifest; otherwise, leave them to their games and distractions.</p>
<p>O people of God, strive so that the hearts of the diverse peoples of the world may be cleansed and purified from hatred and malice by your patience and kindness and become worthy and capable of the manifestations of the sun of truth.</p>
<p>In the fourth Splendor of the Splendors, we mentioned that for every matter an aid is necessary, and in this dispensation, the victorious armies are good deeds and praiseworthy morals. The leader and commander of these armies is the fear of God; He is the possessor of all and ruler over all.</p>
<p>In the third Manifestation of the Book of Manifestations, we mentioned that the cause of the elevation of existence and its exaltation is knowledge, arts, and crafts. Knowledge is like wings for existence and a ladder for ascending. Its acquisition is incumbent upon all, but it should be knowledge that benefits the people of the earth, not knowledge that begins and ends with words. Those who possess knowledge and crafts have a great right over the people of the world. This is testified by the Mother of Utterance in this clear station. In truth, the real treasure for humanity is its knowledge, and it is the cause of honor, bounty, joy, and exultation. Blessed is he who adheres to it, and woe to the heedless. You should, in all circumstances, invite the servants to what leads to the appearance of spiritual virtues and good deeds so that all may become aware of what causes the elevation of existence and strive with complete effort for the highest station and lofty pinnacle. The primary cause for the training of the people is the fear of God; blessed are those who attain it.</p>
<p>The first word inscribed on the first leaf of Paradise from the Most Glorious Pen is this: Truly, I say, the clear safeguard and strong fortress for all the people of the world is the fear of God. It is the greatest cause for the preservation of humanity and the chief reason for its protection. Indeed, an innate quality exists within humans that prevents them from what is unworthy and unseemly, and it is called modesty. However, this quality is limited to a few; not all possess this station. The kings of the age and the scholars of the nations must adhere to religion, for it is the cause of the appearance of the fear of God in others.</p>
<p>The second word inscribed on the second leaf of Paradise is this: The Pen of Utterance now counsels the manifestations of power and the dawning-places of authority, namely the kings and rulers, may God assist them, to adhere to religion and hold fast to it. It is the great cause for the order of the world and the tranquility of those in existence. The weakening of the pillars of religion has caused the strength of the ignorant and their audacity and boldness. Truly, I say, whatever diminishes the lofty station of religion adds to the heedlessness of the wicked, and the ultimate result is chaos and disorder. Listen, O people of insight, then take heed, O people of vision. We hope that you will heed what has been mentioned with attentive ears, that you may make the people aware of what they have and what God has. We ask God to deliver the light of justice and the sun of fairness from the dark clouds of heedlessness and to make them manifest. No light compares to the light of justice; it is the cause of the order of the world and the comfort of the nations.</p>
<p>And in another place: In the Book of the Bayan, this sublime word is inscribed and recorded: Say, O friends, strive so that the tribulations that have befallen the oppressed and you in the path of God are not wasted among the people. Adhere to the hem of chastity, and likewise to the cord of trustworthiness and piety. Consider the well-being of the world, not the desires of the self. O party of the oppressed, you are the shepherds of the world. Keep the sheep from the wolves of self and desire, and adorn them with the ornament of the fear of God. This is the firm decree that has flowed from the Pen of the Ancient at this time. By the life of God, the sword of morals and manners is sharper than the swords of iron. In this time, the innate nature calls and says: O people, the day has come, and my Lord has manifested me with a light that eclipses the suns of the Bayan. Fear the Merciful and do not be of the heedless.</p>
<p>The third word inscribed on the third leaf of Paradise is this: O son of humanity, if you look towards bounty, set aside what benefits you and take what benefits the servants. And if you look towards justice, choose for others what you choose for yourself. Sometimes, humility elevates a person to the heaven of honor and power, and other times, pride lowers him to the station of humiliation and abasement. It is a great day and a mighty call. In a Tablet among the Tablets, this sublime word is mentioned: If the entire spirit world were turned into a hearing power, it could be said to be worthy of listening to this call that has risen from the highest horizon. Otherwise, these ears, tainted with false stories, are not worthy and never have been. Blessed are the listeners, and woe to the heedless.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="promote-the-greatest-peace">Promote the Greatest Peace</h3>
<p>We ask the Most Glorious God to aid the dawning places of wealth and power and the sources of honor and authority, meaning the kings of the earth, may God assist them, to promote the greatest peace. This is the greatest cause for the comfort of the nations. The kings of the realms, may God assist them, should unanimously adhere to this matter, which is the greatest cause for the preservation of the world. We hope that they will arise for what brings the comfort of the servants. A great assembly should be arranged where the kings or ministers are present, and the decree of unity and accord should be enacted, and they should turn from weapons to reformation. If one king rises against another, the other kings should rise to prevent him. In this case, armies and war equipment would only be needed to the extent necessary to protect their countries. If they attain this greatest good, the people of the land will be engaged in their affairs with comfort and joy, and the lamentations and wailings of most of the servants will cease. We ask God to aid them in what He loves and is pleased with. He is the Lord of the Throne and the dust, the Possessor of the hereafter and the first life.</p>
<p>It is better and more appropriate if the great kings themselves are present in that assembly and decree the matter. Any king who rises to this matter and implements it will be the chief of the kings in the sight of God. Blessed is he and well-being to him. In these lands, whenever the turn of the military comes, great fear appears from all directions. Each state annually adds to its military because the ministers of war are eager and speak of further additions. According to reports, the state of Iran, may God assist it, also intends to increase its military. To this oppressed one, a well-organized army of a hundred thousand is sufficient. We hope that His Majesty will add to the light of justice. By the life of God, justice is a mighty army. It is in the foremost position and the highest rank, opening hearts and minds, explaining the secrets of existence, and bearing the banner of love and generosity.</p>
<p>In the treasures of divine knowledge, there is a knowledge that removes fear, but it must be implemented from the days of childhood. It makes a significant difference, and whatever diminishes it adds to boldness. If God’s will aids, a detailed explanation of what has been mentioned will flow from the Pen of Utterance, and perhaps in the realms of knowledge and skills, something will appear that will renew the world and the nations.</p>

<p>Also, a word is inscribed and recorded in the Crimson Tablet from the Most High Pen, which reveals all the hidden strength in the servants, and even adds to it. We ask God, the Most Glorious, to aid His servants in what He loves and is pleased with. These days, enemies are evident from all sides, and the fire of hatred is ablaze. O people of the earth, by my life and your lives, this oppressed one has no thought of leadership and does not, and the aim has been and is to remove what causes the division of the parties of the world and the separation of the nations so that all may be freed and focused on their own affairs.</p>
<p>I ask that the friends do not stain this robe with the dust of lies and do not diminish the rank and station by mentioning extraordinary events that are with them. Glory be to God, today is a day when the wise should take advice from this oppressed one and ask God for what causes honor and comfort. However, all are striving and endeavoring to extinguish this shining and bright light, and every soul is trying to establish a fault or raise an objection. The matter has reached a point where they have declared from all the actions of this oppressed one things that are unworthy of mention.</p>

<p>One of the friends mentioned that a person in the great city said that fifty thousand tomans are sent to Akka every year from the homeland. This was mentioned with great regret, and it was not clear who the accountant was and who kept the records. Anyway, this oppressed one has been patient and silent in all that has been inflicted and said, intending to erase the rule of dispute, contention, and bloodshed from the world with the power of utterance by the grace of the Most Glorious God and His preceding mercy.</p>
<p>In all circumstances, we have adhered to beautiful patience and entrusted the matter to God. However, in response to this point, we mentioned that if the person is truthful in what he has said, he should thank the Owner of existence and the Sovereign of the unseen and the seen for raising a soul from Iran who, without any helper and supporter, has taken control of Iran from prison and collects a tax from it every year. This is a praiseworthy position, not a reproachable one, if one is just. If anyone wishes to be informed about the affairs of this oppressed one, the answer is that in some nights and days, the captives of the world and the oppressed of the nations have passed the night without strength and the day without food. We do not like these mentions and have no complaint against the speaker.</p>
<p>In this prison, a respected person was earning a livelihood by stone carving for some time, and sometimes some were provided food by the bounty of God, meaning hunger. We ask God, the Most Glorious, to aid all in justice and fairness and to enable them to turn and return. Verily, He is the All-Hearing, the Responsive.</p>

<p>“O my God, I have left my will for Your will, and my desire for the manifestation of Your desire. By Your might, I do not desire myself and my existence except to rise for the service of Your Cause, and I do not love my existence except for sacrifice in Your path. O Lord, You see and know that those from whom we sought justice and fairness rose against us with oppression and injustice. Outwardly they were with me, but inwardly they supported my enemies who rose to violate my sanctity. O my God, my God, I bear witness that You created Your servants for the support of Your Cause and the exaltation of Your word, but they supported Your enemies. I ask You by Your command which has encompassed existence and by Your name by which the unseen and the visible were subdued, to adorn the people of the earth with the light of Your justice and to illumine their hearts with the light of Your knowledge. O Lord, I am Your servant and the son of Your servant. I bear witness to Your oneness and singleness and to the sanctity of Your essence and the purity of Your being. O Lord, You see Your trusted ones among the hands of the treacherous of Your creation and the slanderers among Your creatures. You know what has befallen us from those whom You know better than we do. They have committed what has caused the veil of the near ones of Your creation to be rent. I ask You to aid them to rise for what has passed them by in the days of the dawning of Your revelation and the rising of Your inspiration. Verily, You are capable of what You will, and in Your grasp are the reins of those in the heavens and the earths. The call of innate nature has been raised and its yearning, and it calls with the highest call and says: O people, by God, I have attained my appearance and my station. This is the day when the Mount smiled with its Speaker, Carmel with its Dweller, and the Lote-Tree with its Teacher. Fear God and do not be of the deniers. Do not deprive yourselves of what has appeared by grace. Take the Kawthar of life in the name of your Lord, the Possessor of names, and then drink from it with His mighty and wondrous remembrance.”</p>

<section id="from-the-tablet-to-the-sultan-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-tablet-to-the-sultan-1">From the Tablet to the Sultan</h3>
<p>In all circumstances, we have enjoined the servants to what is good and forbidden them from what is bad. The Owner of existence is a witness and testifier that this oppressed one has sought from God for the people that which causes affection, unity, love, and harmony. By the life of God, this oppressed one has not been able to conceal it. He has manifested what He wills, and He is the Omnipotent, the Chosen One. These exalted words that were revealed in the Tablet to the Sultan, some of them we mention repeatedly so that His Majesty may know with clear certainty that what has been mentioned is from God.</p>
<p>O Sultan, I was like one of the servants, resting on my bed. The breezes of the All-Glorious passed over me and taught me the knowledge of what was. This is not from me but from the Mighty, the All-Knowing. He commanded me to proclaim between earth and heaven, and thus came upon me what caused the tears of the knowers to flow. I did not read what the people possess of knowledge, nor did I enter schools. Ask the city where I was so that you may be certain that I am not one of the liars. This is a leaf moved by the winds of the will of your Lord, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Does it have any stability when the strong winds blow? No, by the Lord of names and attributes, it moves as He wills. Non-existence has no existence before eternity. His irrevocable command has come, and He made me speak of His remembrance among the people. I was nothing but like a dead one before His command. The hand of the will of your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate, turned me.</p>
<p>Can anyone speak on his own about what he is accused of by the servants, whether low or high? No, by the One who taught the Pen the secrets of eternity, except for one who is assisted by the Mighty, the Powerful. O Sultan, look with the eye of justice at the oppressed one, then judge with truth about what has befallen him. God has made you His shadow among the servants and a sign of His power for those in the lands. Judge between us and those who have wronged us without evidence or an illuminating book. Those around you love you for themselves, but the servant loves you for yourself and only wishes to bring you closer to the abode of grace and turn you to the right hand of justice. Your Lord is a witness to what I say.</p>
<p>O Sultan, if you could hear the pen of the Most High and the cooing of the dove of life on the branches of the Lote-Tree in the mention of God, the Creator of names and the Creator of earth and heaven, it would lead you to a station where you would see nothing in existence but the manifestation of the Presence of the Worshiped One. You would see the kingdom as the least of things to you; you would give it to whomever you wish and turn towards a horizon that is illuminated by the lights of the face, and you would never bear the burden of the kingdom except to assist your Lord, the Most High, the Supreme. Then the supreme assembly would bless you. Blessed is this most exalted station if you ascend to it with a sovereignty known by the name of God.</p>

<p>Glorified are You, O my God! You see what has befallen the oppressed from those who have not associated with me and have risen against me with harm and adversity, such that pens are unable to describe it, tongues are powerless to explain it, and tablets cannot bear it. You hear the groaning of my heart and the clamor of my being, and what has befallen Your trusted ones in Your lands and Your chosen ones in Your dominion from those who have broken Your covenant and testament. O Lord, I ask You by the clamoring of the lovers in the horizons and their groaning in their remoteness from the court of Your nearness, and by the blood that has been shed in Your love, and by the livers that have melted in Your path, to protect Your friends from the oppression of those who are heedless of the mysteries of Your chosen name. O Lord, strengthen them with Your power, which has overpowered all things, and enable them to be patient and enduring. Verily, You are the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Bestower. There is no god but You, the Generous, the Bountiful.</p>
<p>In these days, some have passed from justice and fairness and have attacked with the sword of malice and the spear of enmity, while the duty of the fair-minded is to assist the rejected of the world and the expelled of the nations and to cling to righteousness and piety. Most people have not known until now what this oppressed one intends and why he has borne innumerable tribulations. Indeed, the tongue of the heart speaks the words “Oh, that my people knew,” and this oppressed one, detached from all, speaks with this sublime word:</p>
<p>“The waves have encompassed the ship of God, the Overseeing, the Self-Subsisting. O sailor, do not be perturbed by the winds. The Splitter of the dawn is with you in this darkness, which has caused the hearts of the servants to tremble, except for those whom God, the Mighty, the Chosen, has willed.”</p>

<section id="the-station-of-self-annihilation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-station-of-self-annihilation">The Station of Self-Annihilation</h3>
<p>O Sheikh, this station is the station of self-annihilation and subsistence in God, and if this word is mentioned, it signifies pure non-existence. This is the station of “I do not own for myself any benefit or harm, nor life nor resurrection.”</p>
<p>O Sheikh, what do the scholars of the age say about the manifestations of the Lote-Tree of the Bayan on the Mount of Knowledge? That sacred one heard the word from the Lote-Tree and accepted it, but most are deprived of understanding this station because they are occupied with what they have and are heedless of what God has. Sayyid Farhad al-Din has spoken well in this regard:</p>
<p>[This word is not comprehended by any superficial understanding, Even if you were Abu Nasr or Abu Ali Sina.]</p>
<p>What do they say about this saying of the Seal of the Prophets, the soul of all else be his sacrifice: “You shall see your Lord as you see the full moon on the fourteenth night,” and the statement of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, in the Sermon of Disclosures: “Expect the appearance of the Speaker of Moses from the tree on the Mount,” and likewise the saying of Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon him: “Could there be a manifestation for others that is not for You, so that it would be the manifestation of You? Blind is the eye that does not see You.” Such statements are mentioned and well-known in the sayings of the friends, peace be upon them, and present in authentic books. Blessed is he who sees and speaks with pure truth. Blessed is the soul that purifies itself from the suspicions and illusions of the world with the help of the Kawthar of utterance, tears the veils of glory with the name of the All-Exalted, and passes beyond the world and its people, aiming for the Greatest Prison.</p>
<p>O Sheikh, the breaths of revelation are distinct from its lower counterpart, and the divine utterance is like a shining sun among the books. Blessed is he who finds and recognizes it and says, “Praise be to You, O desired one of the world, and thanks be to You, O beloved of the hearts of the sincere.” The purpose of mentioning divinity and lordship is not understood by the servants, for if they comprehend it, they will rise from their station and speak the word, “We repent to God.” The Seal of the Prophets, the soul of all else be his sacrifice, says: “We have states with God in which we are He and He is we and He is He and we are we.” This station has also been passed; why have they not mentioned other stations that have been revealed from the Most Glorious Pen? The tongue of the oppressed one has spoken these exalted words in most of the days and nights.</p>

I ask You, O Eternal Sovereign, by the Greatest Name and by the effulgences of Your radiant manifestation in the realm of the Bayan, and by the waves of the sea of Your knowledge in the realm of possibility, to assist me in that which brings me closer to You and cuts me off from all else.</p>
<p>By Your might, O God of all existence and object of all creation, I wish to lay my face on every spot of Your earth, perhaps it might be honored by the presence that was honored by the coming of Your chosen ones. By God, the illusions of the servants have deprived them of the horizon of certitude and assumptions have prevented them from the sealed wine. Truly, I say, and for the sake of God I say, this servant and this oppressed one is ashamed to attribute himself to existence and being, let alone to any ranks above that.</p>

And a person who is aware of this station is certainly sanctified and purified from pride, arrogance, and conceit. What has been said is from God, He bears witness and is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Ask of God ears that hear, eyes that see, expanded breasts, and turned hearts, so that the servants may find the object of their search and turn towards the Beloved. Trials have befallen this oppressed one, the like of which eyes have never witnessed. Despite this, there has been no hesitation in proclaiming the matter, and it was conveyed to the kings and rulers (may God assist them), what would ensure the tranquility, unity, and concord of the world, and the comfort of the nations.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-tablets-to-napoleon-iii">About Tablets to Napoleon III</h3>
<p>Among them, two words were heard from Napoleon III, which led to sending him a tablet in Adrianople. He did not respond. After arriving in the Most Great Prison, a letter and a hand-written note were received from his minister, initially written in Persian and concluded in his own handwriting, showing kindness and mentioning that the letter was conveyed as requested, and until then no response had been given, but their minister in Constantinople and the consuls of those lands were instructed to handle any matter expressed. From this statement, it became clear that they considered this servant’s aim to be the reformation of external matters. Hence, verses were revealed in the Surah of the Temple addressed to him, some of which will be mentioned so that he may know that the matter of this oppressed one is for God and from God.</p>
<p>“O King of Paris, inform the priest not to ring the bells. By God, the Truth, the greatest bell has appeared upon the Temple of the Greatest Name, and it is rung by the fingers of the Will of your Lord, the Exalted, the Most High, in the realm of permanence, by His name, the Most Glorious. Thus, the great verses of your Lord were revealed once again for you to arise for the mention of God, the Creator of earth and heaven, in these days in which the tribes of the earth all mourned, the foundations of cities were shaken, and the people were enveloped in the dust of atheism, except for those whom your Lord, the All-Knowing, the Wise, willed.</p>
<p>Say, the Chosen One has come in the shadows of lights to revive the worlds by the breaths of His name, the Merciful, and to unite the world and gather them on this table which descended from heaven. Beware lest you disbelieve in the grace of God after its revelation; this is better for you than what you possess, for it will perish, but what is with God remains. He is the ruler over what He wills. The breezes of forgiveness have wafted from the direction of your Lord, the Merciful. Whoever turns to it is purified from sin and from every illness and affliction. Blessed is the one who turns to it, and woe to the heedless.</p>
<p>If you were to listen with the ear of nature to things, you would hear from them that the Ancient One, the Glorious, has come. Everything glorifies the praise of its Lord. Among them are those who know God and mention Him, and among them are those who mention Him and do not know Him. Thus, We have encompassed the matter in a clear tablet. O King, hear the call from this blazing fire from this green tree on this lofty mount on the sacred white spot behind the Eternal Sea. There is no god but Me, the Forgiving, the Merciful. We have sent the one whom We supported with the Holy Spirit to inform you of this light which shone from the horizon of the Will of your Lord, the Exalted, the Most Glorious, and its effects appeared in the West. Turn to it in this day which God has made the choicest of days, in which the Merciful manifested Himself upon those in the heavens and the earths.</p>
<p>Rise to serve God and to support His cause. He will assist you with the hosts of the unseen and the seen, and make you a sovereign over what the sun shines upon. Your Lord is the Omnipotent, the Almighty. The breezes of the Merciful have wafted in the realm of existence. Blessed is the one who finds its fragrance and turns to it with a pure heart. Adorn your temple with the robe of My name, your tongue with My mention, and your heart with My love, the Mighty, the Unassailable. We desired for you only what is better for you than what you possess and the treasures of the entire earth. Your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Rise among the servants in My name and say, O people of the earth, turn to the one who has turned to you. He is for the sake of God among you, His proof in you, and His guide for you. He has come to you with signs that the learned of the world are incapable of producing. The Tree of Sinai speaks in the heart of the world, and the Holy Spirit calls among the nations. The Promised One has come with manifest sovereignty.</p>
<p>O King, the stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, those who rely on what they have to prove My cause and mention God by My name. When I came to them with My glory, they turned away from Me. Behold, they are among the fallen. This is what the Spirit told you when He came with the truth and the Jewish scholars opposed Him until they committed what made the Holy Spirit lament and the tears of the close ones flow.</p>
<p>Say, O assembly of monks, do not stay in churches and cloisters. Come out by My permission and then engage in what benefits yourselves and the servants. Thus commands you the Lord of the Day of Judgment. Reside in the fortress of My love; this is the true seclusion if you are of those who know. Whoever stays near the house, he is like the dead. It is befitting for man to show what benefits the servants, and what bears no fruit should be for the fire. Thus your Lord admonishes you; He is the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Marry that someone may arise in your place after you. We have forbidden you from treachery, not from what shows fidelity. Have you taken the roots of yourselves and cast away the roots of God? Fear God and do not be of the ignorant. Were it not for man, who would mention Me in My land, and how would My attributes and names appear? Reflect and do not be of those who are veiled and were of the heedless. The one who did not marry did not find a place to rest his head on or a place to lay down because of what the hands of the treacherous have earned. Sanctifying oneself is not what you know and what you have of illusions but what We have. Ask to know his station, which is sanctified from the assumptions of everyone on earth. Blessed are the knowing ones.</p>
<p>O King, We heard a word from you when the King of Russia asked you about the judgment of war. Your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. You said, I was asleep in the cradle, the call of the oppressed woke me until they were drowned in the Black Sea. Thus We heard, and your Lord is a witness to what I say. We testify that it was not the call that woke you but desire, for We tested you and found you secluded. Recognize the tone of speech and be of the discerning.</p>
<p>We do not wish to return to you a bad word to preserve the station We granted you in the visible life. We chose courtesy and made it a habit of the close ones. It is a garment that suits every soul, young and old. Blessed is the one who made it the adornment of his body, and woe to the one who is deprived of this great favor. If you were the possessor of the word, you would not have cast the Book of God behind your back when it was sent to you from the Mighty, the Wise. We tested you with it, and We did not find you as you claimed. Arise and make up for what you missed. The world will perish and what you have, and the dominion will remain for God, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers. You should not limit matters to what your desire wants. Beware the sighs of the oppressed, protect him from the arrows of the oppressors. What you did will cause matters to differ in your kingdom, and the dominion will leave your hand as a result of your actions. Then you will find yourself in manifest loss, and earthquakes will seize all tribes there unless you arise to support this cause and follow the Spirit in this straight path.</p>
<p>Your pride deceived you, by My life, it will not last, and it will vanish unless you hold fast to this strong cord. We see disgrace pursuing you, and you are of the heedless. When you hear the call from the direction of majesty, you should leave what you have and say, “Here I am, O God of those in the heavens and the earths.”</p>
<p>O King, We were in the mother of Iraq until separation became necessary. We turned to the King of Islam by His command. When We came to him, We received from the hypocrites what cannot be written on pages. Because of this, the dwellers of Paradise lamented, and the inhabitants of the sacred precincts, but the people are in thick veils. (Until We said,) The matter became severe for Us every day, rather every hour, until they took Us out of prison and put Us into the Most Great Prison with clear oppression.</p>
<p>If it is said, for what crime were they imprisoned? They would say they wanted to renew the religion. If the ancient one is your chosen one, why did you leave what was decreed in the Torah and the Gospel? Explain, O people, by God, there is no escape for you today. If this is My crime, Muhammad, the Messenger of God, preceded Me in it, and before him, the Spirit, and before him, the Interlocutor. If My sin is to exalt the word of God and manifest His cause, then I am the first of the sinners. I would not exchange this sin for the kingdom of the heavens and the earths. (Until We said,) The more the calamity, the more the radiance in the love of God and His cause, such that what came upon Me from the heedless did not prevent Me.</p>
<p>If they were to bury Me in the layers of the earth, they would find Me riding on the clouds and calling to God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty. I sacrificed Myself in the path of God and longed for tribulations in His love and pleasure. This is testified by what I am in of afflictions that no one from the worlds has borne. Every hair of Mine speaks what the Tree of Sinai spoke, and every vein of Mine calls to God and says, “Would that it were cut in Your path for the life of the world and the unity of those in it.” Thus the matter was decreed by the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Know that the subjects are the trusts of God among you. Guard them as you guard yourselves. Beware lest you make the wolves shepherds of the sheep, and let not pride and arrogance prevent you from turning to the poor and the needy. Rise from the horizon of detachment in My name, then turn to the kingdom by the command of your Lord, the Omnipotent, the Almighty. (Until We said,) Adorn the body of the king with the robe of My name and rise to proclaim My cause. This is better for you than what you possess, and God will elevate your name among the kings. He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Walk among the people with the name of God and His sovereignty to manifest His effects among the worlds. (Until We said,) Say, O people, does it behoove you to attribute yourselves to the Merciful and commit what Satan committed? No, by the beauty of the All-Glorious, if you are of the knowing. Purify your hearts from the love of the world, your tongues from falsehood, and your bodies from what prevents you from drawing near to God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. Say, the world is your turning away from the source of revelation and your turning to what does not benefit you. What has prevented you today from turning to God is the essence of the world; avoid it and draw near to the great, luminous, shining spot.</p>
<p>O people, do not shed blood and do not judge any soul except with justice. Thus, you are commanded by the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Those who corrupt the earth after its reformation have exceeded what is set in the Book, and evil is the abode of the transgressors. (Until We said,) Do not betray in the wealth of people; be trustworthy on earth and do not deprive the poor of what God has given you of His bounty. He will give you double what you have; He is the Generous Bestower. O people of Baha, conquer the cities of hearts with the swords of wisdom and speech. Those who argue with the desires of their souls are in clear veils. Say, the sword of wisdom is hotter than the summer and sharper than the sword of iron, if you are of the knowing. Bring it out in My name and My sovereignty, then open with it the cities of the hearts of those who are secluded in the fortress of desire. Thus commands you the Pen of the Most Glorious while sitting under the swords of the heedless.</p>
<p>If you uncover a sin, cover it, so that God may cover you. He is the Concealer, the Possessor of great bounty. O assembly of the wealthy, if you see a poor person, do not be proud against him. Reflect on what you were created from; all were created from a despicable water. (Until We said,) Consider the world as a human body afflicted with diseases, and its healing depends on the unity of those in it. Gather on what We have prescribed for you and do not follow the ways of the differing. Reflect on the world and the condition of its people. The one who created the world for Himself has been imprisoned in the most desolate of abodes by the actions of the heedless. From the horizon of the prison, He calls the people to the dawn of the Most High, the Most Great. Will you rejoice in what you have of adornments after knowing that they will perish, or will you be happy ruling over a span of land after all of it was not, in the eyes of the people of Baha, more than the pupil of the eye of a dead ant? Leave it to its people, then turn to the goal of the worlds.</p>
<p>Where are the proud ones and their palaces? Look at their graves to take a lesson from what We made as an example for the observers. If the breezes of revelation touch you, you will flee from the kingdom, turning to the kingdom, and spend what you have to draw near to this noble sight. We commanded one of the assembly of the Holy Spirit to send this tablet, and he mentioned that he sent the tablet and its translation. Knowledge is with God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>And a part of the body of the tablet is for His Majesty the Emperor of Russia (may God, exalted and glorified, assist him).</p>
<p>O King of Russia, hear the call of God, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, and come to the paradise, the place where He who is named with the Most Beautiful Names has settled among the Supreme Concourse and in the Kingdom of creation, by the name of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Majestic. Beware that anything should veil you from turning to your Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. We heard what you called upon your Lord in your seclusion; thus, the fragrance of My favor stirred, and the ocean of My mercy surged. We responded to you with the truth, indeed, your Lord is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.</p>
<p>One of your envoys assisted Me when I was in the prison of Ṭihrán, under chains and fetters. By this, God has decreed for you a station that none but He can encompass. Beware that you do not exchange this great station (until We said). The Father and the Son have come in the sacred valley, saying: “Here I am, O God, here I am.” The mountain circles around the house, and the tree calls with the loudest call: “The Bestower has come, riding on the clouds.” Blessed is he who draws near to Him, and woe to the heedless.</p>
<p>Arise among the people with this firm matter, then call the nations to God, the Mighty, the Great. Do not be of those who used to call upon God by one of the names, but when the Named One came, they disbelieved in Him and turned away from Him until they unjustly judged Him. Reflect and remember the days when the Spirit came, and Herod passed judgment on Him. God assisted the Spirit with the hosts of the unseen, preserved Him with the truth, and sent Him to another land, a promise from Him. He is the ruler over what He wills. Indeed, your Lord preserves whom He wills, even if he is in the center of the sea, in the mouth of the serpent, or under the swords of the oppressors.</p>
<p>(We said) Hear My call once more from My prison to inform you of what has befallen My Beauty from the manifestations of My Majesty, and recognize My patience after My power, and My endurance after My might. By My life, if you knew what has been revealed from My Pen, and if you were to access the treasures of My Cause, the pearls of My mysteries in the oceans of My names, and the containers of My words, you would sacrifice yourself in the path of God, longing for His exalted and unassailable kingdom. Know that My body is under the swords of the enemies and My form is in afflictions beyond count, yet My spirit is in a joy incomparable with the happiness of the worlds.</p>

<p>And thus, some verses of the tablet to Her Majesty the Queen (may God, exalted and glorified, assist her) are mentioned. The intention is that perhaps the breezes of revelation may touch her, and for the sake of God, she may arise to serve the Cause and convey what has not reached from the tablets to the esteemed kings (may God assist them). This matter is great, this service is great. In that land, there are many eminent scholars, including the revered Siyyids known for their greatness and rank. Consult with them, and show them what has flowed from the Supreme Pen. Perhaps they may be assisted in the reformation of the world and the purification of the souls of the nations, and the hidden and stored malice and hatred in hearts may be calmed by the chalice of divine counsels. We ask this success from God, and it is not difficult for Him.</p>
<p>O Queen in London, hear the call of your Lord, the Master of creation, from the divine Lote Tree. Verily, there is no god but Me, the Mighty, the Wise. Forsake what is on the earth and adorn the head of the kingdom with the crown of the mention of your Lord, the Exalted. He has come into the world with His most great glory and completed what was mentioned in the Gospel. The land of Syria has been honored by the arrival of its Lord, the Master of all, and the intoxication of the wine of reunion has taken hold of the south and the north. Blessed is he who finds the fragrance of the Merciful and turns to the dawn of beauty in this radiant morn.</p>
<p>The Aqsa Mosque has quivered with the breezes of its Lord, the Most Glorious, and the sacred precinct has responded to the call of God, the Exalted, the Most High, and every pebble therein glorifies the Lord with this great name. (Until We said) We mention you for the sake of God and wish that your name be exalted with the mention of your Lord, the Creator of the earth and the heavens. He is witness to what I say. We have heard that you have prohibited the sale of slaves and concubines. This is what God has decreed in this wondrous revelation. God has written a reward for you; He is the Bestower of recompense for those who do good. Follow what has been sent to you from the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Whoever turns away and is arrogant after the clear proofs have come to him from the Revealer of the signs, God will render his works vain. He is powerful over all things. Actions are accepted after turning to the truth. Whoever turns away from the truth is among the most veiled of the people. Thus, it has been decreed by the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>We have heard that you have entrusted the reins of consultation to the hands of the people. Well done, for through this the foundations of affairs are solidified, and the hearts of those under your shadow, both lowly and noble, are assured. However, they should be trustees among the servants and see themselves as agents for everyone on earth. This is what they have been admonished in the tablet from the Wise Planner. Whenever anyone turns to the assembly, let him turn his gaze to the highest horizon and say: O my God, I ask You by Your most glorious name to aid me in what reforms the affairs of Your servants and builds up Your lands. You are powerful over all things. Blessed is he who enters the assembly for the sake of God and judges among the people with pure justice. Behold, he is among the victorious.</p>
<p>O members of the councils here and in other lands, reflect and speak on what reforms the world and its condition if you are of the discerning. Look at the world as a human body created whole and perfect, but it has been afflicted with various ailments due to diverse and conflicting causes. It has never been well; its illness has increased due to the hands of quack doctors who have ridden the steed of desire and have been of the heedless, except those whom God, the Lord of the worlds, has willed. And if one of its members were cured at any time by a skilled physician, other members remained as they were. Thus, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed tells you.</p>
<p>Today, we see it under the hands of those who are intoxicated with the wine of pride to such an extent that they do not recognize what is good for themselves, so how can they handle this grave and difficult matter? (Until We said) What God has made the greatest remedy and the perfect means for its health is the unity of those on earth on one matter and one law. This can never be achieved except by a skilled, perfect, and supported physician. By My life, this is the truth, and beyond it is only manifest error. Whenever that greatest cause came and that light shone from the horizon of eternity, the quack doctors prevented it and became a cloud between it and the world, hence the illness was not cured and remains in its sickness until now. They could not preserve its health, and the one who was the manifestation of power among the people was hindered from what he desired due to the actions of the quack doctors.</p>

<p>Look in these days when the Beauty of Eternity has come with the greatest name for the life and unity of the world; they rose against Him with sharp swords and committed what made the faithful spirit tremble. They made Him a prisoner in the most desolate lands, and the hands of the seekers were cut off from His hem. When it was said to them, the reformer of the world has come, they said, it is proven that he is one of the corrupters, while they have not associated with Him and see that He did not preserve Himself for even a moment, always being in the hands of the tyrants. Sometimes they imprisoned Him, other times they exiled Him, and sometimes they moved Him around the lands. Thus they judged Us, and God is aware of what I say.</p>
</section>
<section id="similitude-of-moses" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="similitude-of-moses">Similitude of Moses</h3>
<p>This accusation of corruption is the same as that which the Pharaohs gave to the Interlocutor of God. Read what the Merciful revealed in the Qur’an, His saying:</p>
<p>“We sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority to Pharaoh, Haman, and Qarun, but they said, ‘A magician, a liar.’ When he brought them the truth from Us, they said, ‘Kill the sons of those who believed with him and let their women live.’ But the plan of the disbelievers is nothing but error. Pharaoh said, ‘Leave me to kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord. I fear that he will change your religion or cause corruption in the land.’ Moses said, ‘I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.’”</p>
<p>The reformer of the world has always been considered corrupt and accused of what everyone has heard. Whenever the sun of manifestation rose from the horizon of God’s will, some denied, some turned away, and some clung to false accusations, depriving the servants of the bounty of the Possessor of creation. Thus, those who have not seen this oppressed one and have not associated with Him say what they have heard and continue to say. Say, O people, today the sun of the Bayan has risen from the horizon of the sky of grace, and the light of the manifestation of the Interlocutor of the Mount, the Leader of religions, is shining and radiant. Sanctify and purify your chest, heart, ears, and eyes with the Kawthar of the Most Merciful’s explanation, and then turn. By God, from all things, the call has come, “The truth has come.” Listen, blessed are the fair-minded and happy are the seekers.</p>
<p>Among them, regarding the Blessed Tree, they have said what every discerning scholar and every knowledgeable wise person would testify to its falsehood. Indeed, that person has observed and read the verses revealed about the Interlocutor of God. His blessed saying:</p>
<p>“Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you stayed among us for many years of your life? And you did that deed of yours which you did, and you are of the ungrateful. Moses said, ‘I did it then, being among the misguided. So I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers.’”</p>
<p>And in another instance, His Blessed and Exalted statement:</p>
<p>“And he entered the city at a time when its people were unaware, and he found therein two men fighting, one from his own group and the other from his enemy. The one from his group called for his help against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him and killed him. He said, ‘This is of Satan’s doing. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy.’ He said, ‘My Lord, I have wronged myself, so forgive me,’ and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He said, ‘My Lord, for the favor You have bestowed upon me, I will never be an assistant to the criminals.’ So he became fearful, anticipating in the city, when suddenly the one who had sought his help the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said to him, ‘Indeed, you are clearly a misguided one.’ Then, when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he said, ‘O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the reformers.’’</p>
<p>Therefore, the hearing and sight must be sanctified and purified to adhere to justice and fairness. The Interlocutor of God also confessed to wrongdoing and misguidance and also to fear and fleeing, and disobedience and seeking forgiveness from God, the Exalted.</p>

<p>O Shaykh, God, the Exalted, manifests Himself in His manifestations with the knowledge of doing what He wills and decreeing what He desires. No one has the right to ask why or how, and whoever says otherwise has turned away from God, the Lord of Lords. In the days of the Manifestation, these things are evident and present, just as they have said about this oppressed one what the close ones and the sincere have testified and will testify to be false. By God, this hem has been and is sanctified, even though some have now intended to defile it with the slanders of the unworthy liars, but God knows, and they do not know.</p>
<p>The person who, with the power and might of God, stood against all the factions of the world and invited everyone to the highest horizon, has been denied. And those who have always been behind veils and curtains, occupied with preserving themselves, have clung to these souls. Now some are busy with lies and slander, with no intent other than to introduce doubts into hearts and minds. Whenever a soul turns to this land from the great city, they immediately send a quick report saying that a sum of money was stolen and went to Acre. A knowledgeable, complete, and virtuous person turned to the sacred land at the end of his life, intending seclusion, and about him, they wrote what caused the sighs of the sincere and close ones to rise.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-story-about-the-forgiven-mishir-al-dawlih">A Story About the Forgiven Mishir al-Dawlih</h3>
<p>This oppressed one was known by the late, forgiven Mirza Husayn Khan, Mishir al-Dawlih, may God forgive him, and certainly he mentioned to the authorities of the state the details of the arrival of this oppressed one at the threshold and his words and actions. On the day of arrival, the host of the government was present and took us to a place where he was assigned. Indeed, the utmost love and kindness from the government towards these oppressed ones were evident and witnessed. On another day, Prince Shuja‘ al-Dawlih and Mirza Safa, on behalf of the late, forgiven Mishir al-Dawlih, the minister plenipotentiary, came, and also some of the ministers of the exalted government, including the late Kamal Pasha and some others.</p>
<p>And this oppressed one, relying on God without mentioning any need or request, stayed in that land for four months, and his actions were known and witnessed by all. No one denies them except every hateful liar. Whoever knows God knows nothing other than Him. We have not desired and do not desire to mention such matters. Some of the great ones of Iran, whenever they entered that city, they exerted utmost effort at the doors of houses for salaries and rewards. This oppressed one, if he was not the cause of honor, was not the cause of humiliation either. The actions of the late, forgiven one, exalted be his station, were not due to friendship with this oppressed one but due to the requirements of wisdom and a service he had secretly intended. I testify that he was a trustworthy servant of the government to the extent that treachery had no place in his domain.</p>
<p>The reason for the entry of these oppressed ones into the Most Great Prison was also due to him, but since he was sincere in his actions, he is worthy of good mention. This oppressed one has always intended the elevation and advancement of the state and the nation, not the elevation of his own rank. Now, some have gathered a group and have risen to violate the sanctity of this oppressed one. Yet the oppressed asks God, exalted and glorified, to aid them in returning and to grant them success in rectifying what they have missed and in repenting at His threshold of grace. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-persecution-of-bahaullah-and-his-followers">The Persecution of Baha’u’llah and His Followers</h2>
<p>O Shaykh, my Pen laments for myself, and the tablet weeps at what has come upon me from one whom we protected for many consecutive years and who was meant to serve before My presence day and night, until he was led astray by one of my servants named Sayyid Muhammad. Witness to this are assured servants who migrated with me from Baghdad until we arrived in this great prison. What came from them has caused every scholar to cry out, every gnostic to lament, and the tears of the fair-minded to flow. We ask God to assist the heedless towards justice and fairness and to make them aware of what they have neglected; indeed, He is the Bountiful, the Generous.</p>
<p>O my Lord, do not prevent Your servants from the door of Your bounty and do not drive them away from the expanse of Your proximity. Assist them in uncovering the veils of majesty and in piercing the veils of illusions and hopes. You are the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted. There is no god but You, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>By the sun of proof, which has shone from the horizon of the sky of certainty, this oppressed one has, day and night, been engaged in the purification of souls until the light of knowledge has overcome the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<section id="aided-the-sultan-with-support-despite-persecution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aided-the-sultan-with-support-despite-persecution">Aided the Sultan With Support Despite Persecution</h3>
<p>O Shaykh, it has been repeatedly mentioned for forty years that by divine grace and the effective divine will, we have aided the Sultan (may God assist him) with a support that is evident and proven before the manifestations of justice and fairness and is denied only by every obstinate transgressor and every hateful skeptic. It is strange that the ministers of the state and the trustees of the nation have not, until now, acknowledged this clear and evident service, or perhaps they have and, out of wisdom, have not mentioned it. Before forty years, every year among the servants, disputes and conflicts were manifest and ongoing, and afterward, by the armies of wisdom, explanation, counsel, and knowledge, everyone held fast to the strong cord of patience and the luminous hem of endurance, such that they bore whatever befell this oppressed party and put it to right. Despite the severe torment inflicted in Mazandaran and Rasht on many people, including Haji Nasir, who was truly a light shining from the horizon of the sky of submission, after his martyrdom, his eyes were gouged out, and his nose was cut off, and the oppression reached such a degree that the people of foreign countries wept and mourned and secretly aided his family and children.</p>
<p>O Shaykh, the Pen is ashamed to mention what has happened, and in the land of Ṣad (Isfahan), the fire of oppression burned so fiercely that every fair-minded person lamented. By your life, from the cities of knowledge and wisdom, the wailing and weeping rose to such a degree that the hearts of the people of righteousness and piety were consumed. The two bright lights, the two Hasanayn (Imams Hasan and Husayn), freely gave their lives in that land, neither wealth nor honor prevented them. God knows what befell them, and most people are unaware. Before them, Jinab Kazim and those with him, and later the noble personage, drank the cup of martyrdom with utmost eagerness and longing and hastened to the Exalted Companion. Likewise, during the time of Sardar Aziz Khan, Jinab Mirza Mustafa and those with him were taken and sent to the Exalted Companion and the most glorious horizon.</p>
<p>In every city, the signs of oppression were evident and manifest, an oppression unparalleled. Yet, no soul rose in defense. Consider the case of Badi, the bearer of the Tablet to the Sultan, and reflect on how he gave his life. That champion of the arena of detachment offered the precious crown of life to the One True Friend.</p>
<p>O Shaykh, if these matters are denied, what matter is worthy of affirmation? Make it clear for the sake of God and do not be among the silent. Jinab Najaf Ali was seized, and with utmost attraction and eagerness, he sought the station of martyrdom and proclaimed this word: [We found its value and its blood’s value] He said this and gave his life. Consider the radiance and effulgence of the light of detachment that shone from the lofty heart of Mulla Ali Jan, the attraction of the supreme Word and the power of the supreme Pen so captivated him that the field of martyrdom and the pavilion of joy were equal in his sight, indeed, the former was more desirable.</p>
<p>Reflect on Jinab Aba Basir and Sayyid Ashraf of Zanjan. They brought Umm Ashraf to persuade her son to counsel him, encouraging him until he attained the supreme martyrdom. O Shaykh, this party has crossed the Gulf of Names and pitched their tent on the shore of the sea of detachment. They would sacrifice a hundred thousand lives freely and would not speak against the will of God. They are attached to the will of God and free from what the people possess. They gave their lives and did not speak an unworthy word. Reflect, as if they drank from the sea of detachment, the life of this world did not prevent them from martyrdom in the path of God.</p>
<p>In Mazandaran, a large number of the servants of God were destroyed. The ruler, based on the fabrications of some, plundered them, claiming they had gathered weapons. After investigation, it was found that there was only one old gun barrel without any parts. Glory be to God, this party had no need for weapons, for they had girded the loins of endeavor for the reformation of the world. Their armies were good deeds, their weapons were pleasing morals, and their commander was the fear of God. Blessed is he who is just.</p>
<p>By God, this party has become the manifestation of justice in patience, tranquility, submission, and contentment, and they have reached such a degree of endurance that they were killed but did not kill, even though the oppressed of the land suffered what the history of the world has not recorded, and no eye has seen its like. Why did they accept these great calamities and not lift a hand in defense? What was the reason for their submission and tranquility? The reason was the prevention of the supreme Pen, day and night, and taking control of affairs by the power and might of the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Reflect on Jinab Badi, that oppressed one who was seized and ordered to curse and abuse this oppressed one. But by the grace of God and divine mercy, he chose martyrdom and attained it. If you count the martyrs in the path of God, you would not be able to count them. Reflect on the case of Sayyid Ismail (peace and blessings be upon him), who, before dawn, swept the door of the house with his turban and then at the edge of the river, facing the house, sacrificed his life with his own hands.</p>
<p>Consider the influence of the Word. All these souls were first ordered to curse and abuse, but none placed their will above the will of God.</p>
<p>O Shaykh, from the time of the Interlocutor of God, there was one soul, and now this oppressed one has revealed to you that which causes the fair-minded to be bewildered. Be just for the sake of God and arise to serve your Lord. He will reward you with a reward that cannot be matched by the treasures of the earth or the stores of kings and sultans. Rely upon God in all matters and entrust them to Him; He will give you a reward that is great in the Book.</p>
<p>In these few days of life, engage in deeds that spread the fragrance of His pleasure and are adorned with the ornament of acceptance. When Bilal the Ethiopian’s deed was accepted, his ‘sin’ surpassed the ‘sin’ of the world. Today, all parties must be illuminated with the light of unity and agreement. However, the pride and arrogance of some parties have ruined wisdom and demolished the house of justice.</p>
<p>O Shaykh, what has befallen this oppressed one is unprecedented, and we have borne all this with utmost submission and contentment for the purification of souls and the elevation of the Word of God. During the days when we were in the prison of the land of M, we were handed over to the hands of the scholars for one day; it is clear what happened then. If you ever enter the storehouse of the Sultan, ask the deputy and the head of that place to show you the two chains, one called “Baqara Kahar” and the other known as “Salasil.” By the Sun of Justice, this oppressed one spent four months in one of these chains, suffering and fettered.</p>
<p>And my grief is less than Jacob’s, and all the calamities of Job are but a part of my affliction.</p>
<p>Reflect also on the martyrdom of Haji Muhammad Rida in the city of love. The oppressors inflicted upon him what caused some foreign nations to weep and lament, for, according to reports, thirty-two wounds were inflicted on his blessed body, yet no one intervened. They always placed the decree of the Book above their own will, even though there were many of this party in that city.</p>
<p>We request that the Sultan (may God exalt and glorify him) himself consider these matters and judge with justice and fairness, even though in many cities of Iran in recent years, this party has been killed and not killed. It is observed that the malice of some hearts is now more apparent than before. The intercession of the oppressed for their enemies before the rulers has been the highest of deeds; it has certainly reached the ears of some that the oppressed party interceded for the murderers in that city before the ruler and sought leniency.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-tablet-of-ahmad">From the Tablet of Ahmad</h3>
<p>Reflect, O people of insight.</p>
<p>O Shaykh, these clear verses were revealed in one of the Tablets from the Supreme Pen:</p>
<p>“O servant, hear the call of the oppressed one who bore hardships and afflictions in the path of God, the Lord of Names, until he was imprisoned in the land of Ṭihrán. He called people to the highest paradise, but they seized him and led him through the cities and lands. How many nights did sleep flee from the eyes of My beloved ones out of love for Me, and how many days did the factions rise against Me? At one time, I saw myself on the highest mountains, and at another, in the prison of Ṭihrán, in chains and fetters. By God, I was thankful, speaking, remembering, turning, content, submissive, and humble in all conditions. Thus, My days passed until they ended in this prison, which caused the earth to tremble and the heavens to lament. Blessed is the servant who casts aside doubts when the concealed one comes with the standards of signs. We informed people of this greatest Manifestation, but they are in a wondrous intoxication. At that time, the call rose from the direction of the Hijaz, proclaiming: Blessed are you, O ’Akká, for God has made you the source of His most sweet call and the dawning place of His greatest signs, and blessed are you for the throne of justice that is established upon you and the shining light of grace and favors from your horizon. Blessed is the fair-minded one who is just in this greatest mention, and woe to every heedless doubter.”</p>

<section id="from-the-tablet-of-proof" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-the-tablet-of-proof">From the Tablet of Proof</h3>
<p>And after the martyrdom of some of the martyrs, the Tablet of Proof was revealed from the sky of the Cause by the Lord of religions.</p>
<p>He is the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>The winds of enmity have surrounded the ship of the sacred precinct by the actions of the oppressors. O you who are renowned for knowledge, you have passed judgment on those for whom the books of the world have lamented, and all the records of the religions have borne witness, and yet you, O distant one, are in a thick veil. By God, you have judged those by whom the horizon of faith has shone. The sources of revelation and the manifestations of the command of your Lord, the Merciful, bear witness to this, those who have sacrificed their souls and all that they possess in His straight path. The religion of God has cried out from your oppression against it, and you are playing and are among the rejoicing ones. There is no enmity in my heart towards you or towards any of the servants. The knower sees you and your kind in manifest ignorance. If you were to perceive what you have done, you would cast yourself into the fire or leave your house, heading to the mountains, and lament until you return to a station decreed for you by the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O deluded one, tear the veils of doubts and illusions to see the sun of knowledge shining from this radiant horizon. You have cut off a part of the Messenger, thinking you have supported the religion of God. Thus, your soul has deceived you, and you are among the heedless. The hearts of the Supreme Concourse have burned from your actions, and those who circle around the command of God, the Lord of the worlds. The heart of the Virgin has melted from your oppression, and the inhabitants of paradise have lamented in a noble station. Be just for the sake of God; by what proof did the Jewish scholars judge against the Spirit when He brought the truth? By what argument did the Pharisees and the idol scholars reject when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, brought a book that judged between truth and falsehood with justice, whose light illuminated the darkness of the earth, and the hearts of the wise were attracted? And today, you have reasoned with what the ignorant scholars of that age used. The Lord of the greatest favor, in this great prison, bears witness to this.</p>
<p>You have followed them, but you have surpassed them in oppression, thinking you have supported the religion and defended the law of God, the All-Knowing, the Wise. By His own self, the Supreme Lawgiver mourns your oppression, and the law of God, by which the breezes of justice have blown upon those in the heavens and the earth, cries out. Did you think you gained from what you decreed? No, by the Sovereign of Names, you have lost; He has knowledge of all things in a preserved Tablet.</p>
<p>O heedless one, you have not seen me, nor have you associated with me, nor have you spent even a moment with me, so how did you order the people to curse me? Did you follow your desire or your Lord in this? Bring forth a sign if you are among the truthful. We testify that you have cast aside the law of God and taken up the law of your own self. Nothing escapes His knowledge; He is the Unique, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>O heedless one, listen to what the Merciful revealed in the Qur’an: “Do not say to those who greet you with peace, ‘You are not a believer.’” Thus, the one who holds the dominion of command and creation in His grip has decreed if you are among the listeners. You have cast aside the decree of God and taken up the decree of your own self. Woe unto you, O heedless and dubious one. If you deny me, by what proof do you establish what you hold? Bring it forth, O you who associate partners with God and turn away from His sovereignty, which encompasses the worlds.</p>
<p>Know that the learned one is the one who acknowledges My manifestation, drinks from the ocean of My knowledge, flies in the air of My love, casts aside all else but Me, and takes up what has been revealed from the kingdom of My wondrous revelation. He is like the eye to the body and the spirit of life to the body of existence. Exalted be the Merciful who has recognized him and set him upon the service of His mighty and great Cause. The Supreme Concourse and the inhabitants of the Pavilion of Grandeur, who have drunk from My sealed wine with My mighty and powerful name, pray for him.</p>
<p>If you are among the people of this highest station, then bring forth a sign from God, the Creator of the heavens. And if you recognize your own weakness, take hold of the reins of your desire and then return to your Lord. Perhaps He will forgive your sins, which have burned the leaves of the Lote-Tree, made the rock cry out, and caused the eyes of the wise to weep. By you, the veil of lordship was torn, the ship sank, the camel was hamstrung, and the Spirit lamented in an exalted station.</p>
<p>Do you oppose the one who has brought you what you possess and what the people of the world have of the proofs and signs of God? Open your sight to see the oppressed shining from the horizon of the will of God, the true Sovereign, the Manifest. Then open the hearing of your heart to hear what the Lote-Tree speaks, raised up with the truth from God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Despite what has come upon it from your oppression and the injustice of those like you, the Lote-Tree calls with the loudest call and invites all to the Lote-Tree of the Utmost Boundary and the highest horizon.</p>
<p>Blessed is the soul that sees the greatest sign and the ear that hears its sweetest call. Woe to every heedless sinner. O you who turn away from God, if you see the Lote-Tree with the eye of justice, you will see the marks of your swords on its branches, twigs, and leaves after God created you to recognize and serve it. Reflect, perhaps you will become aware of your oppression and be among the repentant.</p>
<p>Did you think we fear your oppression? Know and be certain that on the first day the sound of the Supreme Pen was raised between the earth and the heavens, we spent our souls, bodies, children, and wealth in the path of God, the Most High, the Great, and we take pride in this among the inhabitants of creation and the Supreme Concourse. This is attested by what has befallen us on this straight path. By God, hearts have melted, bodies have been crucified, blood has been shed, and the eyes have looked toward the horizon of the grace of their Lord, the Witness, the Seeing.</p>
<p>Whenever the trials increased, the people of glory increased in their love. Their truthfulness is attested by what the Merciful revealed in the Qur’an: “Then wish for death, if you should be truthful.” Is the one who preserved himself behind veils better or the one who spent it in the path of God? Be just and do not wander in the wilderness of falsehood among the wandering.</p>
<p>The Fountain of the love of the Merciful has taken them in such a way that neither the cannons of the world nor the swords of the nations prevented them from turning to the ocean of their Lord’s grace, the Generous Bestower. By God, trials have not weakened me, nor has the rejection of the scholars disheartened me. I spoke, and I speak before all faces; the gate of bounty has been opened, and the dawn of justice has risen with clear signs and brilliant proofs from God, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Present yourself before the face to hear the secrets of what the son of Imran heard on the Mount of Knowledge. Thus commands you the dawning place of the manifestation of your Lord, the Merciful, from the direction of His great prison.</p>
<p>At that time, the call of nature rose again and its longing and said: The Mount calls and says, O people of the Bayan, fear the Merciful, for I have attained the presence of My Speaker, and the joy of My delight has taken the pebbles of the earth and its dust, and the Lote-Tree says, O people of the Bayan, be just in what has appeared with the truth. The fire that God revealed for the Interlocutor has appeared. This is attested by every discerning eye. ```</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-purpose-of-recounting-the-past">The Purpose of Recounting the Past</h2>
<p>O Shaykh, some of the martyrs of this Manifestation have been mentioned, as well as some of the verses revealed in their honor from the Kingdom of Revelation. It is hoped that you, detached from the world, will reflect upon what has been mentioned. Now consider Mirza Hadi Dawlatabadi and Sad Isfahani in the land of Ṭa (Ṭihrán). When Hadi heard he was called a Babi, he was so disturbed that he lost his composure and tranquility. He ascended the pulpits and spoke words unworthy of mention. The hypocrites of the world have always acted out of a love for leadership, causing the misguidance of the servants. Do not consider such individuals as similar to those steadfast, firm, assured, composed, and dignified martyrs of this Manifestation. Their constancy, steadfastness, assurance, composure, and dignity were mentioned so that you may become aware.</p>
<p>The purpose of what has been stated in the Tablets to kings and others is for you to know with manifest certainty that this oppressed one did not conceal the Cause of God. He proclaimed it to the leaders of the world with the most eloquent speech. However, weak souls like Hadi and others altered the Cause of God, acted for the fleeting life of this world, and spoke what caused justice to weep and the Supreme Pen to lament, even though they were and are ignorant of the essence of the Cause. This oppressed one declared for the sake of God: O Hadi, you went to your brother and saw; now turn to the court of the oppressed. Perhaps the breezes of revelation and the breaths of inspiration will support you and grant you success.</p>
<p>Today, whoever witnesses the signs can distinguish truth from falsehood as clearly as the sun from the shadow and will become aware of the goal. God is witness and knows that what has been mentioned is for the sake of God, that perhaps you may become a means of guiding the people and save the parties of the world from doubts and illusions. Glory be to God, until now the deniers and rejecters do not know what was sent to the Herald, the Point. The knowledge is with God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strive-and-serve-the-cause">Strive and Serve the Cause</h3>
<p>O Shaykh, strive and arise to serve the Cause. Today, the sealed wine is evident before all faces. Take it in the name of your Lord, then drink it with His mighty, wondrous mention. This oppressed one has been engaged day and night in uniting hearts and refining souls. The events that took place in Iran in the early years truly caused grief to the close ones and the sincere. Every year there was killing, plundering, and bloodshed. One year in Zanjan, what occurred caused the greatest consternation. Another year in Nayriz, and another year in Ṭabarsi, until the event of the land of Ṭa occurred. After that, this oppressed one, with the help of God, the Exalted, has made this oppressed party aware of what is fitting. All are sanctified from what they possess and what the people possess, and are attached to what is with God.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bahaullah-wants-what-the-sultan-wants">Baha’u’llah Wants What the Sultan Wants</h3>
<p>Now the Sultan (may God preserve him) should treat this party with kindness and compassion. This oppressed one, the leader of God’s Sacred House, pledges that nothing will appear from this party but truthfulness and trustworthiness, which is not contrary to the views of the world-adorning Sultan. Every nation should consider the position of its ruler, be submissive to his command, act by his decree, and hold fast to his judgment. Kings are the manifestations of the power, elevation, and grandeur of God. This oppressed one has never flattered anyone; all bear witness to this fact. However, considering the status of kings is from God, and it is clear and known from the words of the Prophets and saints.</p>
<p>In the presence of the Spirit (Jesus), it was asked: “O Spirit of God, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?” He said: “Yes, render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s and unto God what is God’s.” He did not forbid it, and these two words are one to those who perceive, for what is Caesar’s would not be lawful if it were not from God. Likewise, in the blessed verse: “Obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.” The primary and foremost meaning of “those in authority” are the Imams (may the peace of God be upon them), who are the manifestations of power, the sources of command, the treasuries of knowledge, and the dawning places of divine wisdom. In the secondary rank, it refers to the kings and rulers whose light of justice illuminates and brightens the horizons of the world. It is hoped that from the Sultan (may God preserve him) a light of justice will shine that will encompass all the parties of the nations. All should ask God for what is befitting today for His sake.</p>

<p>O my God, my Master, my Guide, my Purpose, and my Beloved! I beseech You by the secrets that are hidden in Your knowledge, by the verses from which the fragrance of Your bounty wafts, by the waves of the ocean of Your gifts, by the sky of Your grace and generosity, by the blood that has been shed in Your path, and by the hearts that have melted in Your love, to empower the presence of the Sultan with Your might and dominion so that there may appear from him that which will remain in Your Books, Scriptures, and Tablets. O Lord, take his hand with the hand of Your power, illuminate him with the light of Your knowledge, and adorn him with the qualities of Your attributes. You are the Omnipotent over whatever You will, and in Your grasp are the reins of all things. There is no God but You, the Forgiving, the Generous.</p>

<section id="all-power-is-ordained-by-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="all-power-is-ordained-by-god">All Power is Ordained By God</h3>
<p>Saint Paul the Apostle wrote in his Epistle to the Romans: “Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” He states that the manifestation of kings and their power and authority is from God. This has also been mentioned in the previous traditions, which the learned have seen and heard.</p>
<p>We ask God, exalted and glorified, to assist you, O Shaykh, to hold fast to what has been revealed from the heaven of God’s bounty, the Lord of all worlds. The learned should unite with the Sultan and uphold that which preserves and protects the blessings and wealth of the servants. The just Sultan is, before God, closer than all. This is testified by the one who speaks in the Most Great Prison. God, there is no god but Him, the Unique, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>If you would spend one hour for the sake of God reflecting on what has appeared before and after, you would turn from what you have to what is with God and become a cause for the exaltation of the Word of God. Has there been any manifestation or appearance from the dawn of divine will that the tribes of the earth have accepted and embraced? Who was he, and what was his name? From the Seal of the Prophets, may our souls be a sacrifice for him, and before him the Spirit (Jesus) to the First Point (the Báb), during the times of their manifestations, they all faced trials. Some were called mad, some were labeled liars, and they acted in such ways that the Pen is ashamed to mention them. By God, what befell them caused all things to lament, yet most people remain in manifest ignorance. We ask God to assist them to return to Him and repent at His threshold of mercy; He is capable of all things.</p>

<p>At this time, the cry of My Supreme Pen has been raised, saying: Counsel Shaykh as you have counseled one of your branches, that the breezes of explanation may attract him and draw him nearer to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>Be generous in times of wealth, and thankful in times of loss. Be trustworthy in your obligations, radiant in your countenance, a treasure to the poor, a counselor to the rich, responsive to the call, faithful to your promises, fair in judgment, silent in gatherings, just in rulings, humble before people, a light in darkness, a relief to the sorrowful, an ocean to the thirsty, a refuge to the distressed, a supporter and helper to the oppressed. Be devout in your deeds, a haven for strangers, a healing balm to the sick, a fortress to the seeker, an eye to the blind, a guide to the lost, an adornment of truthfulness, an ornament of trustworthiness, a throne of ethics, a spirit to the body of the world, a banner of justice, a light to the horizon of goodness, a shower for the good earth, a vessel for the ocean of knowledge, a sun for the sky of generosity, a crown for the head of wisdom, a white gleam for the forehead of time, and a fruit for the tree of humility. We ask God to protect you from the heat of hatred and the chill of coldness; He is near and responsive. Thus, my tongue has spoken to one of my branches, and I have mentioned it to my loved ones who have cast aside illusions and taken up what they were commanded on the day the sun of certainty shone from the horizon of the will of God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<p>This is a day in which the birds of explanation have sung on the branches in the name of their Lord, the Most Merciful. Blessed is he who flies with the wings of longing to God, the Lord of the Day of Reunion. God is aware, and the trustworthy ones bear witness, that this oppressed one has always been under great peril. Were it not for the trials in the path of God, my existence would not be pleasant, and my life would not benefit me. It is not hidden from those with insight and those who look to the greatest vision that during most of my days, I have been like a servant sitting under a sword suspended by a single thread, not knowing when it would fall, whether immediately or after a while. In all of this, we thank God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-supplication-to-god-written-in-multiple-prior-tablets">A Supplication to God (Written in multiple prior tablets)</h3>
<p>And the tongue of the secret has spoken these supplications in the nights and days:</p>
<p>Glorified are You, O my God! If it weren’t for the trials in Your path, how would the rank of Your lovers be revealed? And if it weren’t for the hardships in Your love, how would the station of Your ardent seekers be established? By Your might, the companion of Your lovers is their tears, and the solace of Your devotees is the sighs of their hearts, and the nourishment of those who strive toward You are the fragments of their hearts. How sweet is the poison of death in Your path, and how noble are the arrows of the enemies for the exaltation of Your word! O my God and my Lord, make me drink in Your cause what You will, and send down upon me in Your love what You have destined. By Your might, I desire nothing but what You desire, and I love only what You love. I have placed my trust in You in all conditions; verily, You are the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. I beseech You, O my God, to manifest for the aid of this Manifestation those who are worthy of Your name and Your dominion, that they may mention You among Your creation, raise the banners of Your victory in Your kingdom, and adorn them with Your attributes and commandments. There is no God but You, the All-Observing, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>At that moment, the call of nature was raised again and again, crying out and saying: “O people of the earth, by God, I am the primal nature among you. Beware that you do not deny Me; God has manifested Me with a light that has encompassed all who are in the heavens and the earth. Be just, O people, in My Manifestation, My emergence, and My effulgence, and do not be among the oppressors.”</p>

<p>O Shaykh, this oppressed one asks God, exalted and glorified, to make you the opener of the gate of justice and to manifest His Cause through you among the servants. Verily, He is the Mighty, the Powerful, the Bestower.</p>
<p>O Shaykh, beseech God to purify the ears, eyes, and hearts of the world and protect them from the desires of the self. For the purpose of the disease is a significant one; it deprives a person of the knowledge of the presence of the True One and bars them from the illuminations of the lights of the Sun of Certitude.

<p>At this time, the call has been raised from the right of the radiant Spot: God, there is no God but Him, the Wise Commander. Present to Shaykh the remainder of the Tablet of Proof to draw him to the horizon of the appearance of his Lord, the Merciful, so that he may rise to support the Cause with clear verses and exalted proofs, and speak among the servants what the tongue of proof has spoken. The sovereignty belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds. Read the Book of Certitude and what the Merciful has revealed to the King of Paris and his like, so that you may understand what was decreed before and be certain that We did not seek corruption on the earth after its reformation. We only remind the servants purely for the sake of God; whoever wishes may accept, and whoever wishes may turn away. Indeed, our Lord, the Merciful, is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>O parties of the world, nothing of your possessions will benefit you today, nor any name among the names, except for this name which God has made the Manifestation of His Cause and the Dawning-place of His most beautiful names for those in the kingdom of creation. Blessed is he who finds the fragrance of the Merciful and is among the steadfast. Today, your knowledge and arts will not avail you, nor your decorations and pride. Leave everything behind and turn to the supreme Word by which the scriptures and scrolls were detailed, and this clear Book.</p>
<p>O people, set aside what you have written with the pen of doubts and illusions. By God, the Sun of Knowledge has risen from the horizon of certitude. O heedless one, if you are in doubt about what we are upon, we testify by what God testified before the creation of the heavens and the earth: there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Bestower. We testify that He was one in His essence and one in His attributes; He had no equal in creation and no partner in invention. He sent the messengers and revealed the books to guide the creation to the straight path.</p>

<p>Did the Sultan observe and overlook your actions, or was he seized with fear by the howling of a pack of wolves who cast behind them the path of God and took up your way without proof or book? We heard that the realms of Iran were adorned with the ornament of justice, but when we examined, we found them to be the rising places of oppression and the dawning places of tyranny. We see justice under the claws of oppression; we ask God to deliver it by His power and authority. Indeed, He is the Overseer over those in the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p>No one should object to a soul regarding what has come upon the Cause of God. Every person who turns to the highest horizon should hold fast to the cord of patience and trust in God, the Sovereign, the Chosen. O lovers of God, drink from the fountain of wisdom, fly in the air of wisdom, and speak with wisdom and eloquence. Thus, your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Knowing, commands you.</p>
<p>O heedless one, do not be content with your pride and power. You are like the remaining rays of the sun on the mountain peaks, which will soon be overtaken by the descent from God, the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Your pride and the pride of those like you have been taken away. This is what has been decreed by Him from whom comes the Mother of Tablets.</p>

<p>Where are those who fought against God, where are those who disputed His signs, where are those who turned away from His sovereignty, where are those who killed His chosen ones and shed the blood of His friends? Reflect, perhaps you will find the fragrances of your deeds, O heedless doubter. Because of you, the Messenger lamented, the Virgin cried out, homes were ruined, and darkness spread over all regions. O scholars, because of you, the station of the community has fallen, the banner of Islam has been overturned, and its great throne has been toppled. Whenever someone discerning sought to uphold that which would elevate the station of Islam, your uproar arose, preventing what was intended, and the kingdom remained in great loss.</p>
<p>O my Supreme Pen, mention the one who, by her oppression, caused all things to lament, and the limbs of the holy ones to tremble. Thus, your Lord, the Possessor of Names, commands you in this exalted station. The Virgin has cried out from your oppression, yet you think you are of the family of the Messenger. Thus, your soul has deceived you, O you who turn away from God, the Lord of what was and what will be.</p>
<p>Be just, O venomous one, by what crime did you sting the sons of the Messenger and plunder their possessions? Did you disbelieve in the one who created you by His command “Be,” and it is? You have done to the sons of the Messenger what ’Ad and Thamud did not do to Salih and Hud, nor did the Jews do to the Spirit of God, the Lord of existence.</p>
<p>Do you deny the signs of your Lord, which, when revealed from the heaven of the Cause, all the books of the world submitted to? Reflect, that you may become aware of your actions, O heedless rejected one. The fragrances of punishment will seize you as they seized those before you. Wait, O you who associate partners with God, the Lord of the unseen and the witnessed. This is the day of which God spoke with the tongue of His Messenger. Reflect to recognize what the Merciful revealed in the Qur’an and in this written Tablet. This is the day in which the dawning-place of revelation has come with clear signs, which those who count have been unable to enumerate. This is the day in which everyone with a scent has found the fragrance of the Merciful in creation, and everyone with sight has hastened to the Euphrates of the mercy of their Lord, the Sovereign of kings.</p>
<p>O heedless one, by God, the discourse of the sacrifice has returned, and the sacrificed one has turned towards the abode of sacrifice and has not returned by what your hand has gained, O stubborn hater. Did you think that by martyrdom the station of the Cause would be diminished? No, by the One who made it the abode of revelation, if you are among those who understand. Woe unto you, O you who associate partners with God, and to those who took you as a leader for themselves without proof or clear book. How many oppressors have risen to extinguish the light of God before you, and how many sinners have killed and plundered until their oppression caused hearts and souls to lament? The sun of justice has set, as the structure of oppression has settled on the throne of enmity, yet the people are unaware.</p>

<p>O ignorant one, you have killed the sons of the Messenger and plundered their possessions. Say, did the possessions disbelieve in God, or their owner, according to your claim? Be just, O heedless veiled one. You have taken oppression and cast aside justice; thus, all things lamented, and you are among the heedless. You have killed the great and plundered the small. Do you think you will consume what you gathered through oppression? No, by my own self, thus informs you the All-Knowing. By God, what you possess and have gathered through tyranny will not benefit you. Your Lord, the All-Knowing, bears witness to this. You have risen to extinguish the light of the Cause; soon your fire will be extinguished by a command from Him. He is the Omnipotent, the Mighty. The affairs of the world do not weaken Him, nor do the powers of nations. He does as He wills with His sovereignty and decrees what He desires.</p>
<p>Reflect on the she-camel; even though it is an animal, the Merciful raised it to a station where the tongues of the world speak of it and praise it. Verily, He is the Overseer over those in the heavens and the earth; there is no God but Him, the Mighty, the Great. Thus, we have adorned the horizons of the sky of the Tablet with the suns of words. Blessed is he who attains them and is illumined by their lights, and woe unto the deniers, and woe unto the heedless. Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
