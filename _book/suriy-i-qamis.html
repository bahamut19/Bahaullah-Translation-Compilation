<p>1 This is the Surah of the Shirt, we have revealed it with the truth and made it a manifestation of the structure among the worlds.</p>
<p>2 O people of permanence in the highest assembly, hear the call of God through this stirring breeze moving in this gentle air, under this gentle and pleasant sky. Indeed, it is the announcer of the Great Pilgrimage to the people in this greatest word, which was inscribed on the structure of the lines in this Book by the pen of glory and grace. Say, it is indeed the greatest book, which was sealed with the seal of God and concealed behind the veils of the unseen, and stored in the treasuries of glory. It has appeared with grace in the form of justice during the days that were promised by the truth. O delight of the soul, send down from the heaven of Your grace upon the realm of possibilities what will enrich them from what is between the earth and the heavens, for they were in poverty in the secret of the secret, and upon the extinction of this dome, at the appearance of this beauty, they were, by Your permission, standing.</p>
<p>3 Oh light of my soul, indeed, the polytheists have been in doubt about your matter after what We have made you speak in the tone of remembrance when the light emerged in this appearance that has risen in this state which has risen above these two names in these two shining suns in the two beauties. Indeed, you will not grieve, so be patient and then persevere because indeed, your Lord, the Most Merciful, guards you against the forces of Satan, and indeed, He has been wise in the worlds since He pierced the veils from your face, and then the swimming from your beauty, and then He looked from the top of Paradise to the structure of light in the form of the soul, and do not turn to anyone and do not turn back your gaze to the faces of the polytheists and turn towards the direction of the Throne towards your Lord, and indeed, He is sufficient for you over all worlds, and indeed, He supports you with the truth and aids you in every time just as He supported you with grace wherein He made the soul speak in your chest and made you a shining light in the worlds. Say, ‘By Allah, I am the great spectator in the highest council, the most sacred beauty in the most brilliant horizon, the most conspicuous word at the utmost tree, the great news at the sidrat al-muntaha, the hidden ascension in the power of destiny, and the secret of Allah and His command in the Kingdom of Bad’ah.’ By the signal of my pen, the judgment of the Kaf has appeared between the earth and the sky and the command of the Nun in the cities of names. Indeed, your Lord, the Generous, has preferred you with truth and made you a strong pillar in the worlds. Say, ’I am the greatest pillar and the most complete word, and whoever holds onto me has held onto the strong rope of Allah in this clear news that was behind the curtain of protection and beyond the veils of greatness, in truth, concealed.</p>
<p>4 Oh, the joy of life at the beginning of glory, by God, you are the ruler in this sky, so rule as you wish with what has been established from you, the rulings of fate have been confirmed with the signature. Indeed, the suns and moons are subject to your command. Indeed, the command is yours in the power of survival, and to you, the creation is in the kingdom of the earth and the heaven. Indeed, your Lord, besides Whom there is no deity, has made you a supporter and a helper for the worlds with pure truth. Oh, people of the earth, did you think that you would enter paradise in this Eden that appeared on the temple of satisfaction in this garden without love for this eternal, unique, timeless, everlasting, foreign, Arab, divine youth? What an evil assumption you have made within yourselves; for the abode of the evildoers has been in the fire that was in the depths of the abyss, ignited by justice. Say, “Indeed, we have sent terror upon the hearts of the polytheists, and in the hearts of the monotheists, peace has been brought by the grace of this Book that has been sent down to the worlds from the unseen heavens by divine grace.”</p>
<p>5 O people of possibility, listen to the melody of God in the axis of the paradise of Firdaus from the holy Sidrat tree which was planted in the land of saffron by the hands of the Merciful. Say, “By God, with a melody from it the light was manifested over the high mountains in sacred Sinai, behind the veil of delight, for Moses the speaker in the flutter of eternity, near the utmost tree of this burning yellow fire, I am God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.” And indeed, He was encompassing over the worlds.</p>
<p>And with a melody from it, the souls moved in the bodies of the possible, and the rooster of the Throne sang_between heaven and earth. And the Holy Spirit spoke the beautiful language of invention. Through it, the “kaf” and “nun” of divine rule appeared, God’s blessings were completed for whoever was in the heavens and the earth, and the beauty of God appeared in the embroidery that everyone was stunned by in the kingdom.</p>
<p>O people of the earth, neither will you accept this beautiful afterlife nor this great delight. Die in your hatred, as it has, indeed, appeared in the truth, and God has made it light for the monotheists and fire for the polytheists. And indeed, He was all-seeing in everything.</p>
<p>Say, no one’s call will be raised to God today except for those who enter eternal paradise. Be gone, this word which speaks the truth on this high mountain which was on the noble command. Say, it is the Book of God and it is the sealed scroll which was preserved in the niches of protection within the treasures of power, in truth.</p>
<p>O people of the heavens and the earth, can you break through the corners of this fortress which was made of iron bars and raised behind the mountain of glory? Can you even get out of God’s land? No, by the one who is no god but Him, you will not be able to penetrate or escape if you cling to this yellow thread in this air which shone in this sky which was manifested on this darkness which became red in color at the axis of this remaining of which nothing could be seen by the eyes of the people of the sky so you will surely be written by the pen of God as one of the people of paradise in holy delight.</p>
<p>6 Can you believe that you, the people of eloquence, would say like those before you that the Hand of God is tied? Or do you think in yourselves that the doors of grace have been closed after they have always been open in the face of the heavens and the earth? Say: By God, verily the door of the Holy Sanctuary has been opened on the right side of Paradise, and from it has appeared the Beauty of Eternity with a clear authority. This is the one whom God has made a bringer of glad tidings for the monotheists and a warner for the polytheists. Truly, it is the lamp of God between the heavens and the earth, lit by its essence with the oil of its own self so that the people of the highest assembly may receive light from it, as well as the people of the Red Lagoon, and the people of the Holy Gulfs behind the curtains of grandeur. Such has been the decree written by the pen of destiny on the tablet of signing with the truth.</p>
<p>7 O delight of existence, do not withhold the outpourings of Your bounty from the possible things, and do not be veiled by the veils of the signs. So, move beyond the chambers of rubies, then spend the wine of life in this pleasure from the cup of the Most Merciful, at the hand of this youth who was witnessed on the horizon of holiness with the embroidery of God. Beware not to close your eyes to grace, and do not withhold the abundance of generosity from the servants, and do not look to them or what they have, but look with the greatest view to the station of honored glory. So have mercy upon them, then rise in this heaven the clouds of might and eternity, and rain upon the possible things the beloved rains of grace, for you are the Noble in the dominion of the names, the possessor of ancient grace in the realm of eternity, and the possessor of the great generosity in the divinity of blindness. And indeed, you were in the highest assembly above the throne, renowned for your bounty. Say, “The beauty of the Most Merciful and the radiance of the Most Glorious has appeared in the temple of man, so blessed is God who sent him with the truth and taught this pen in the secret of the line the wisdom of the statement, and indeed he was capable of everything.”</p>
<p>8 Oh joy of the soul, tell people the blessings that we have given you before the existence, in the smallest atoms of survival and before the structures of things are adorned with the shirt of names, when Adam the survival was in the mud of fate by the secret order. If the dissidents of the disbelievers respond to you, do not be sad, for you sanctify the tail of your cloak from the indications of the manifestations of Names and Attributes as we purified you from the knowledge of every wretched disbeliever. Stand firm for the order, then speak between the earth and the heavens with what we communicated the spirit in your chest, and rely on Allah, your Lord, in the evening of holiness and the illumination of closeness, for He is sufficient for you with truth against every unjust sinner. So approach Allah your Lord, then turn away from other than Him. We guard you with the authority of power and strength, and protect you with the infallibility that the creation did not comprehend all together. Your command will thus become apparent, and we raise your name among the Names, and mention you in the Holy Tabernacle with the tongue of truth Honesty. Thus, we send down to you the verses of the command and alternate the verses for you to be the supreme argument from your Lord on all worlds.</p>
<p>9 To remember, O Allah the Greatest, how can I remember the initiation of your mention with what you have inspired me after the polytheists surrounded me from all sides, and indeed, you were a witness to that. I swear by Allah, I have lost the thread of my affairs and become bewildered when hatred appeared in the hearts of those who did not believe in you in the blink of an eye, and indeed, you were knowledgeable about them. And when I look at the initiation of your gifts and donations on my behalf and seeking nearness to you, my soul shakes with longing for meeting you. And when I look back at my trials with your innocence, my existence is disturbed for fear of your judgment, and you are the Knower of the truth in all things, and you were an expert in all things.</p>
<p>10 O comfort of life, do not be sad for anything or fear anyone, and then spend on the people of the divine flutter from the arch of life, on the full sanctity of the mighty, from the red wine, and on the people of the tent of sovereignty and dominion from the white cup, from this pure, clear milk; and then on the people of humanity from the jugs of judgment, and on the people of brilliance such that it separates them from everything and attracts them to the hidden holy ancient. Beware that you do not look at the polytheists and what their hands have earned; then look with the higher look at your ancient, eternal beauty that has shone with the truth from the horizon of the Supreme Name, and indeed it will be sufficient for you against everything and protect you from the throwing of the devils and will raise you justly to a unique rank of dignity. For you are Hussein in the mighty names, and by the Supreme, you have been mentioned in the circle of the Throne. And if the matter becomes difficult for you, do not grieve within yourself, then be patient on my way, for the reward of the patient has been written in the Mother of the Book by the pen of holiness. Say that the judgment has come from this signature and decrees what it wants for those in the heavens and the earth, from the Presence of the Mighty, Wise. O people of the earth, do you invoke the names that you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has not given any authority and abandon the one who has come to you with a great authority? Fear Allah and do not follow what your souls command you; then follow the command of Allah and His ways in what He has revealed in the explanation that the judgment is only from Him, and indeed He is knowledgeable about everything. And do not be stingy with what Allah has given you from His bounty; then spend what you have been provided with if you are poor, Allah will enrich you from His bounty, indeed He is Powerful over everything. Soon Allah will reward those who believe and then spend the best reward from Himself and will admit them into ancient holiness in His pleasure. Indeed, when we wanted to seal the word, we heard the cry between the earth and the sky, “O beauty of greatness in the precious garment, do not prevent the ears from the melodies of your holiness, nor the eyes from the kohl of the recognition of your beauty, nor the suns from the gleams of the lights of your favors, nor the hearts from the breezes of your love, nor the possibilities from the drippings of the abundant mercy that was encompassing the worlds.” Indeed, the houris of Paradise and the people of the abodes of intimacy and those who were behind the Throne in the positions of holiness descended from the chambers of life and stood in the air above the head in this holiest, purest space, and they wanted to hear your sweeter chirpings in this Supreme Station. By Allah, indeed silence is beloved except for your wonderful melodies, and the infallibility is sought except in your protected matter, and patience is praised except for your precious, dear, shining beauty. And indeed, you have been with your true knowledge, knowing what I say. By Allah, the truth is that your stored hills have intertwined the livers of the loved ones, and the verses have returned to the mighty correctness, and the structures of the names have been stripped of the dresses of the attributes, and the things have been gathered in the clothes of grief between the earths and the heavens. And indeed, you are the One who is able, by your judgment, to do what you want with your authority, and indeed, you have been omnipotent over everything.</p>
<p>11 And indeed, when we heard the caller of the Merciful from the direction of pleasure, we ended the first tune and then began with another tune. Perhaps the people of drunkenness from the first hatred would be fair in this matter of the most marvelous, the most creative, and the highest. They would pay less than an atom that moves in this air and witness the power of their Lord in secret and public.</p>
<p>12 So exalted is He who revealed the verses with the truth, just as He revealed to Ali with the truth, and before him to Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and before him to the Spirit, and before him to the Word, that there is no god but He. He has the command in the power of existence; He gives life and causes death, then He causes death and restores life, as He is the everlasting, not perishable, the sovereign who cannot be overcome, a king who cannot decay, an outward that cannot be hidden, and an inward that does not reveal. In His hand is the dominion of everything, and indeed He is the Almighty, the Chosen One. O people, fear God and do not disbelieve in the signs of God, nor in the one who boasts of meeting the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, and those other than them who are close to God, who are provided for at all times with the beauty of the divine countenance they behold. Say, O people, this is the soul of God among you and His authority within you; beware of denying the signs of God after they have been revealed with truth like the rains, for indeed the rains pour and settle, but the signs are revealed at all times, without exhaustion. Those who have been granted the insights of the sacred bear witness that they have been revealed from the power of God, the Guardian, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O people, if you disbelieve in the signs of God, in which narration have you believed in God on the day when the feet of every knower slipped and the skin of every believer shuddered and the sight of every believer was dazzled? Fear God, O eloquent men, and do not argue with what you have believed in before, and be just to yourselves and do not differ in what has elevated your names, and do not follow every polytheist deceiver. Say, do you take for yourselves lords other than God to act as the nations of separation did? Woe unto you, and what your hands have wrought, you will return to your place, and the abode of the wrongdoers is nothing but fire.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who purify the word of God and are eagerly struck by it, those who are given the nectar of holiness from the hand of this eternal, everlasting, everlasting, eternal divine boy, who came to you on the clouds of command with sovereignty and power. O eloquent men, do you read the verses and disbelieve in the one who revealed them? By God, the truth is that no one has done as you have done, nor has any nation committed what you have committed. Woe unto you, O multitude of the wicked, and indeed you have been deceived in yourselves, so that you have forgotten God’s covenant and broken His promise, and turned away from the one by whose command you were created and the heavens and the earth were created. There is no god but Him, to Him belongs the creation and the command. He descends to whomever He wills, whatever He wills, and each of them has an allotted share.</p>
<p>Say, we have enjoined upon you in the explanation not to disbelieve in the signs of God when they come to you with truth, and indeed we have not revealed the explanation except for this news that the divine nectar has been inscribed on unfaltering tablets with the gaze fixed upon them. When we came to you from the east of the spirit at another time, you turned away from the straight path, disbelieved in God’s grace, and followed every doubting rejecter. By God, the truth is that today no one will know us except those whose hearts’ mirrors have been purified, and their gaze has been cleansed from looking at anything other than God. They are the companions of the heights, who know their Creator in every matter, and cling to the firmest handle in this strong, spotless bond. Thus, we relate the verses, and cast upon you what will suffice you instead of every treacherous polytheist. Say, O people, indeed I shall not fear for myself but for the one who comes after me on the Day of the Fire that will flare up and illuminate with its light.</p>
<p>By God, the truth is that, O eloquent people, you do with this servant what the nation of separation had not done with Ali, nor the Christians with Muhammad, nor the Jews with Jesus, nor those who were before them with the messengers of God. And they bear witness to what you have done to this servant after he came to you with the authority of command and with him is a proof that no one of knowledge and power can overcome.</p>
<p>13 Oh people of eloquence, have you not forgotten the time when the Most High came to you with authority by the command, and the scholars of distinction denied him until they issued a fatwa against him and killed him? It was an ordeal in which the heavens and the earth wept, the closest ones lamented, the people of the curtains of nearness and holiness, and beyond them the stones and the trees, and only a few of you believed in him. When he returned once more to distinguish the truthful from the liar, then you denied him and rejected him until you disbelieved in what you had believed in before, and God suffices as a witness between us. Whoever possesses the knowledge of secrets, say, “You are known among the higher assembly for lying and in the powers of eternity for doubting and in the dominion of names for disbelieving, for you have disbelieved in the signs of God after having used them as proof of your status.” This is how God makes apparent the treachery of souls and what release and the polytheists hide. Whoever said these verses were not revealed upon the human nature, by God, had indeed appeared upon the structure of a servant who stood at the door with submission and penitence, roaring and saying, “Woe to you, O assembly of the oppressors! By God, I have been created according to the command of the Most High.” Such a witness testifies to itself, but these evildoers do not understand. By God, it boasts of its relationship to our true self, while we have always been rich without it. We created it and everything by the command of the Most High,20 and none denies this except every denier, disbelievers, who set their lying tongues to them so that they say what they do not feel and fabricate lies against God. Say, “Who is more unjust than him who fabricates lies against God and denies his verses after having been revealed in the nights and mornings?” Say, “Die in your rage; there is no escape for you today except that you deny what is with you or affirm what has come down from the power of the command from near the Mighty, the Chosen.” Say, “Do you say as the scholars of distinction said, or do you not feel ashamed of God who created you and provided for you and taught you the manifestation of his own self with signs which minds and thoughts have failed to comprehend?”</p>
<p>14 You, the soldiers of God, purify your hearts from the memory of these people, then stand up for the victory of God and His command. Then, take the Book of God with strength from us and do not turn to the polytheists and what they say, for today they have no argument left and nothing will benefit them except the striking of necks by the swords of God, the Almighty, the Powerful. By God, you, the beloved ones, if you drink from this cup which cuts off souls from everything else and raises them to a position where they will not fear anything in the heavens and the earth and will not be disturbed by their small number or the abundance of the wicked. By God, who is the only deity, if any of you stand up to support our cause, God will give him victory over a hundred thousand and if he increases in his love, God will give him victory over those in the heavens and the earth. Thus, at that time, we breathed the spirit of power into all the parts so that the dwellers of Paradise may settle in whatever part they are and God may support them, their Creator, in all nights and days.</p>
<p>Then know that those whose hearts were attached to something other than what is in the heavens and the earth will not be able to enter my kingdom, for God has sanctified this position apart from anything else and made it the abode of the righteous. So strive for this position and do not deprive yourselves of this favor and do not be the companions of the Fire. Indeed, those who disbelieve in God and His authority, those are the ones who will be overwhelmed with humiliation, and they will have no protector from God. They will soon be seized by the whip of dominion from God, the Almighty, the Subduer. So We revealed the verses to you, and We made it clear by what We manifested from this highest Pen, to be a reminder for the scholars.</p>
<p>Then know, O people, that God has made all the letters of these words for the contentment that is broader than what is counted by the people of capability. Then those who have settled behind the veils of light at the manifestation of this appearance, from what is revealed to them of the lights of the Exalted Glory, have sat in it the meanings of the Houris and the statement of the secrets of this divine youth who has settled on the throne of forgiveness. And if one of the unveiled beauties reveals herself to the people of the heavens and the earth, they would all be electrocuted, nay obliterated, except for those who held to the rope of this beauty, which alone stood out in the realms by the grace of the bestower and spoke the beauty of the unseen in his heart at all times, saying, “You are God, there is no deity but You, the Controller, the Enchanter.”</p>
<p>15 And when we wanted to conclude our speech, we heard the call of the Merciful once again from the direction of the Throne above the pleasure, saying: “O beauty of the foot, I swear by My beauty, then by My splendor, then by My command that you do not fall silent about your sweetest melodies, and then turn the verses on your other tunes because the people of the unseen from the worlds of darkness want to hear your charming melodies, and you are indeed capable of what you want and you are indeed the Mighty, the Invincible.”</p>
<p>16 Oh the joy of the matter, remind our chosen servants in the shadow of the lights in all aspects, hoping that the tune of the Almighty will make them steadfast in the matter, so that they would not replace the chosen garment from their structures and stand for victory in the name of the victorious, the mighty, the prevailing, the all-powerful. Say indeed, the remembrance of God with His beloved ones is to be sweeter than every sweet thing and more honorable than everything created between the heavens and the earth. By God, if people only knew what came down upon them from the signs of God, the Guardian, the Mighty, the Protector, they would ransom their souls and spend their wealth hoping for a trace of the effects of their Lord. And thus We cast upon you some of the wisdom of God so that you may be among the knowledgeable.</p>
<p>17 O my name, listen to the call of your Lord when He established Himself on the throne with the authority that surrounded all possibilities, so that you may stand firm on the matter and be among the winners. Then know that we have been tested under the claws of hatred and I will not find for myself any supporter other than Allah, the Lord of all worlds, and what has happened to us was not witnessed by the chosen ones of Allah before, and no ear of all beings has heard the likes of it. So We inform you of the news of the Spirit so that you may support it with what you are capable of, and be firm on its matter.</p>
<p>Say that He will not need anyone, and that victory is all within His grasp; He gives victory to whom He wills by the order from Him, and He is the Almighty, the Omnipotent, the Wise. And if He were to command people to support, it would be His favor on them to reach what they want and He is independent of all worlds, and in His hand is the kingdom of everything, and in His right hand is the command and the mighty news, so they flee to the right and to the left and put their fingers in their ears lest they hear the tones by which the hearts of those at the top were attracted and the minds of monotheists were bewildered. And we have recorded this matter on the Tablets of Fate, behind veils of protection, and informed you of it on this Clear Tablet.</p>
<p>Say, O my people, this is the mercy of Allah upon you, which encompasses the atoms, have you ever seen anything more wonderful than this? It is by your Lord, the Most Merciful, but most people are in great veils. Say, this is the breeze of holiness that comes from the east of the matter, and have you ever seen anything better than this? It is by my generous soul if you are truly believers.</p>
<p>Say, O you who are eloquent, we have believed in what has come down from Allah in all ages, in Ali and what has descended upon him from among the verses of Allah the Mighty, the All-Knowing, and before him in Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, and before them in the chosen ones of Allah and His apostles who penetrated the realms of existence and rose up to the horizon of mercy with a clear authority and an illuminating proof. Say, we believe in them and in what they have of Allah’s Sunnah and His religion, and then in Allah’s laws and commandments. There is no deity except Him, to Him belongs creation and the matter, and all the things in the imperishable tablets.</p>
<p>Thus, the servant testifies to himself and all existence, both the unseen and witnessed, testifies to this if you are among the witnesses. Say, O my people, by Allah, this is the truth that Ali has emerged with the authority that no eyes of those who are secluded in the tents of glory, beyond the veils of light, have ever perceived. So how can the eyes of these oppressed ones perceive it when oceans of life have flowed to his right and the forces of mercy have surrounded him? So exalted is He who appears in the pole of possibility, oh sublime beauty! So exalted is this most wondrous, most exclusive, most ancient creation!</p>
<p>18 Oh beauty of the origin, remember in the book the contentment of the soul so that it may be satisfied with itself, and what dripped onto its heart from the clouds of holiness of the divine rains. Perhaps the veils will burn with the fire that manifested in the axis of possibility, and the void of illusions will be penetrated by the authority of the Almighty, the Mighty, and the Able. Say, O servant, do not fear anyone in the path of your Lord, take the cup of life on your right hand, and then spend it on those you find on the side of pleasure in this paradise that appeared on the right of the Most Merciful. And if you find yourself unable to bear the word from this greatest weight, then seek strength in my name, the Capable, the Knowledgeable, the Expert. And if your vision deems you weak against the abyss of illusions, then seek insight in my name, the All-Seeing, the Watcher, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Stand up for the command, then take the staff that we gave you in the secret of those words. Then split the sea of illusions in those days when every one in the heavens and the earth was taken by softness, except for those who were chosen by your Lord, the Most Merciful. Indeed, He protects whom He wills, and indeed, He is Able over all things. Say, “By Allah, the beauty of the first one has appeared once again, and has been transformed from the light of the face’s lights less than the poison of the needle, to those in the darkness and the earth.” Then the mountaineers were shocked by the high mountain of this radiant and strong beauty after He had informed us about it in the tablets of His glory and preservation. You read what descended from our beauty in the first one in the origin of the names, so you know the secret of the matter in this secret covered by mysteries and behind the veils. What the hands of injustice have acquired from these evildoers, and no one knows that except Allah, the Mighty, the Invulnerable. If you look at the secrets of your Lord from the book and know the orbit’s rule after the first orbit, beware not to show it to anyone or move your tongue with it because the people of the abyss of permanence will not be able to hear it but will perish instantly. Beware, beware! Hide the beauty of the matter from those who disbelieve and associate partners with God. Witness the beauty of the origin in the mirror of your heart, then enjoy it and be grateful. Hide the beauty of Allah from the eyes of the polytheists and his secrets from the hearts of the oppressors. By Allah, the Truth, those were days in which Allah tested all of the prophets, the messengers, and those behind the veil of infallibility and the tent of greatness and the concealment of might. How were the polytheists, who took themselves as gods, when they manifested the sovereignty of Allah, His power, His greatness, and His majesty? They put the palm of indifference to their sights and accelerated in plotting to confuse the servants. In this way, we cast upon you what will protect you from the throwing of these devils. If you wish to drink from this Sharia which flowed from the right of bounty and by what was promised in the axis of pleasure from the Kafur and the Salsabil, sever all ties with everything in the heavens and the earth and everything upon which the rule of names has run in the dominion of beginning to open the doors of meanings and explanations on your heart. Then look with the secrets of the Most Merciful in this pleasure and be among the certain. O contentment of the soul, ponder on what has descended on you from the presence of the Mighty, the Knowledgeable, in the hope that you may know what Allah has intended for you to know about yourself, and you may attain the position decreed for you in the glorious, noble tablets. We have indeed sent you this shirt that was sprinkled with the blood of truth so that you may look at what is hidden from the eyes of the worlds, except for those whom your Lord wills, those who are not hindered by veils, no signs, and no prevention of any preventions. If it appears in the forms of the pure ones and the cherubim, they look with the great vision in this purest beauty and know the proof by itself, not by any other, because its evidence is its verses, and its existence is proof of it. Thus was the matter before and after, if you were among the knowledgeable.</p>
<p>19 Oh comfort of existence, say by Allah, we have not revealed in the tablets a word in the tune of the marvelous apart from what we have cast upon the pen of the secrets of eternity, because we found the eloquence filled with drunkenness, neglect, and illusion that cannot be compared to the boredom of the other. Therefore, the structure of pride hid from them its most luminous beauty by a thousand veils of light, lest the eyes of these traitors turn back to it. Cry about what was sent down upon me from those who disbelieved, associated with others, and were veiled in themselves argumentatively. By Allah, what we have suffered from the beloved ones is greater and more severe than what we have suffered from the disbelievers. The heavens are about to split, the Earth is about the crack, the mountains are about to collapse, the pillars of the Throne are about to annihilate, the Gates of Paradise are about to crumble, and the hearts of the near ones are about to burn when the pen of the matter cries, the eternity paper resonates, and the immortality pigeon wakes up. Allah wants to establish the faith of His servants after all creation with His command and the testimony of all that He created between the heavens and the earths. Say, O people, we believe in the messengers of Allah and His chosen ones and what was revealed to them from the signs of Allah the Almighty, the noble sender. By which sin did you deny this abundance that no clouds of the matter carried like it and was not reached by the clouds of generosity, and the eyes of the near ones did not witness it?</p>
<p>20 So, O delight of existence, divert the pen from mentioning those and do not let the traitors enter under the tent of your sweetest memory, by God, whatever flows from your ink is beloved by the people in the gathering of the Most High. Hence, it is dear to me that your precious fingers should be moved without mentioning your wonderful and great memory. Then, seal the mentioning of the polytheists and begin with the mentioning of the monotheists, from your beloved ones. Perhaps you will firmly establish them with the beautiful melodies of your fortress on your strong and lofty path, for the polytheists are of the utmost hypocrites and wanted to instill enmity into the hearts of the beloved ones. Those who have passed through the ocean of existence, they did receive the remaining messages, and thus did we secure the matter in the clear Book.</p>
<p>21 So that, O satisfaction of the soul, remember the chosen ones of God who were on your land there, they will rejoice within themselves for what has moved upon their names by the pen of the Almighty, All-Knowing God. Among them is the one named Muhammad, we reminded him of a mention from Our Presence so that he may take pride in that among the worlds. Say, O servant, erase from your heart every mention other than My Mighty, Impenetrable Remembrance, and make your fortress My love, then your cloak My command, then your shield My remembrance, then your companion My beauty, and then entrust yourself to Trusting in My Gracious, All-Powerful, Exalted, All-Knowing Self.</p>
<p>22 Then, remember the one who was named after me, so his name shall remain in the domain of the blind omnipotence and the realm of eternity, and he shall be one of those who remember. Say, O servant, be grateful to Allah for what He has made you equal to himself and has sent His blessings upon you when you were present before the throne, on the seat of truth, at the mighty and powerful Mālik. So, strive to show in your days what is appropriate for this manifest, elevated, and fortified name. Remind yourself, then remind others with this blessed and illuminating name.</p>
<p>23 Then he reminded Al-Haa and Al-Seen of the authority of remembrance to prostrate his face on the ground for the sake of Allah, your Lord and the Lord of all in the kingdom. Say, “O Hassan, be good as Allah has been good to you.” Then purify yourself to reveal his true self and your heart from the footsteps of the polytheists. Forsake the world and those in it and upon it in your shadow. Then seek refuge in my shadow, which encompasses all possibilities and resides in the proximity of the sacred ones.</p>
<p>24 Then remember the verses of the Merciful, which descend from the direction of the great Throne. Say, “O time, stop first and cut off from time and what it contains so that you can ascend to the sublime ascents, standing before your generous, mighty, and powerful ancient Lord.” By Allah, nothing will benefit you today except my love, so adhere to it and be among the believers. And if you are humiliated by my name, do not grieve and rely on Allah, for He will protect you from the harm of the devils if you steadfastly love your master. In this way, nothing will deter you from what He has created and is creating, and this is the trait of the righteous. Then remind your son from Our presence, then adorn his head with the crown of closeness from this strong and precious pen.</p>
<p>25 Then Reza announces the good news of the spirit that took refuge under the shadow of his Lord for months and years. Say, O servant, do not grieve for the separation, for we have sent you before us and written your name in the tablets of nearness, among the closest ones. Do not forget the melodies of your Lord, nor His benevolent breaths, nor the lights of His beauty at the time when they will rise among you, and from which the people of the High Assembly will be illuminated. Then remind his father, his son, his brother, and those with him who were present before their Lord and upon whom the face was revealed with the lights of holiness and tranquility. Say, verily, we have caused for you springs from the mountain of holiness in the secret of this pleasure, springs of al-Kawthar and al-Salsabil.</p>
<p>26 If you, O people of eloquence, do not deprive yourselves and then draw near to it and be not among the patient ones, by God, the truth, you have indeed won what no one has ever won before you, if you recognize the grace of God that has descended upon you from the clouds of holiness and be among the steadfast. Likewise, We have favored you and sent down upon you grace from all directions, and from this sacred, exalted, and impregnable shore.</p>
<p>27 O Pen of the Holy, remind the dust to remember itself, and turn to the face of its Lord, and be among the detached. Say, O servant, rise from the dust and from what comes out of it so that you may know your Exalted and First Lord, and be among the winners. By Allah, the Truth, today there is no escape or refuge for anyone except under the shadow of My glorious and radiant Face, and at the door of this good pleasure, the angels of command are standing on My name - the Protector, the Hearer, and the Knower. If they find any trace of the world’s odors or what has appeared between the heavens and the earth, they will prevent them from entering this good pleasure and from standing before your Lord, the Gracious, the Ancient One. Thus, the Warqas should teach you, and those who believe in Allah, the Mighty, the Unique, the Unrivaled.</p>
<p>28 Then, al-Hussain reminded [them] of what the Trustworthy Spirit reminds [us] with clear holy verses, so that they may soar in the air of proximity and recognize Allah their Lord and the Lord of the worlds during those days in which no one has purified his face for the face of his Lord, and they all worship illusions as their previous worshippers did. And so, it was and it will be, and my Merciful Soul stands witness to what I say. Then, mention in the book the remembrance of our other servants in the assembly of the sanctified ones, saying: “Indeed, al-Hassan, then Ali before Nabil, then al-Hassan each of the righteous ones, then Muhammad before Ali, then the servant before Ali, then Ali before Rida, then our righteous servants, all of the devoted ones, and for each [of them] is a measure in the Tablets of Holiness that none of the worlds can enumerate. Allah is the one who created them and supported them with His command, and made known to them the manifestation of His Self, and made them among the believers. And they shall attain this station by not altering the favor of Allah upon themselves, and if they change it, Allah shall change it upon them. Indeed, there is no god but He, to Him belongs all creation and the command, and everything is with Him in an all-knowing Leader.”</p>
<p>29 Translation:</p>
<p>Say, O beloved ones of the Most Merciful, to emerge from behind the veils of possibility and swim in the oceans of creation with the strength of your Lord, the Bestower. Then stand firm in His command betwixt the heavens and the earth so that even if all that has ever been and all that ever will be, with all their power, were to come together to change you from the state you’re in, they would be utterly unable. Rather, they would bear witness to their own impotence to do so. Thus does God make the truth manifest through His words and establish the matter by His signs, if you are truly among those who know.</p>
<p>Purify the mirrors of your hearts so that they may reflect the light of these beauties that have dawned in the horizon of majesty and gleam in the center of decline. Only by the light emanating from this beauty will everything in the heavens and the earths become illumined, save those who disbelieve in the signs of God, who deny His proof, reject His traces, turn away from His Beauty, and are among the heedless.</p>
<p>Astagairenes Sinai says: “By God, the mountains are astonished at the divine decree, the blind flee from this heavenly melody, and the spiritual will die in this terror from which everything recoils, save those who are taken by the hand of Grace from the Almighty, the All-Powerful.”</p>
<p>O people, recite the words of God with the sweetest of melodies so that they may attract the dwellers of the earth and heaven. By God, if anyone recites what has been sent down as divine precepts from the Beauty of the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the Most High, God will, by His grace, cause that person to be resurrected in the Paradise of immortality, in that radiance from the light of His Beauty will the inhabitants of the Most High and the dwellers of saraadaq al-quds, and those of khubaa al-khifaa who have not been seen by the eyes of those who disbelieve in the signs of the Most Merciful, all at this time, visit.</p>
<p>Know then that those who have been present before the Throne have attained to that which none other has ever attained. So does God bestow His grace upon whomsoever He will of His creation, for there is no god but He, Who does what He wills and decrees what He desires. His generosity is limitless and His bounty knows no bounds. He singles out for His favor whom He wills. There is no god but He, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>Concerning those whose names We mentioned upon the Tablet: some of them have soared to the heights of holiness while others have remained near the edge of this world. Each has a portion with his Lord, and each is in the mighty scrolls of His dominion. As for those whose names We have not mentioned, you should remind them of the spirit with which they were created, for your Lord is the Almighty, the Overcomer, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>30 And if you are victorious with this tablet in which the secrets of what was and what will be are detailed, rise from your position, then place it on your head and say:</p>
<p>31 Glory be to You, O Allah, my God, I bear witness with my tongue and my heart that Your extraordinary blessings have encompassed all atoms of what You created between the earth and the heavens, so that there is nothing left but has received Your proof, and has been illuminated by Your evidence, and has been reached by Your word, and Your authority has manifested to it, and Your signs have descended upon it, and the effects of Your bounty have appeared to it. O my God, I have severed myself from everything other than You and have stood before the pavilion of Your glory and the repository of Your favor/patience, purifying my heart and tongue from the love of anything other than You and the remembrance of anything other than You. O my God, then allow me entry under the shade of Your unity tree and the Lotus Tree of Your mighty and unique sovereignty, then grant me the sweetness of Your verses and what has hidden in them of the intimate secrets of Your knowledge concerning what You intend for Your servants. O my God, do not deprive me of the breaths of Your sanctity, which blow on the form of the glad tidings of meeting You, and on the images of the verses from the source of Your favor. Indeed, You are the All-Powerful over what You wish, and indeed, You are the Giver, the Mighty, the Merciful. Then, my God, make me steadfast on Your command, which none can stand upon except those who have severed themselves from everything in the heavens and the earth. Then, my God, establish a firm footing for me on the path of Your love and a high seat in the presence of the lights of Your divine countenance. Then join me with Your devoted servants.</p>
<p>32 Thus, we taught you and made you aware after we inspired you, and we made you testify after we informed you so that you would thank Allah, your Lord, in your heart and be in great joy and attraction in a unique and beautiful way. If a spark of the flame of longing that we ignited in the holy Lote Tree on Sinai caught you, it would draw you to the station where the realm of names and attributes witness in your shade, and you would find yourself in a height that the dwellers of the heavens and the earth cannot reach. In this ancient format, the Pen of the Eternal inspired you to be firm and steadfast.</p>
<p>33 Oh letter J, take my shirt and throw it on the potentialities’ faces, so that the attributes may appear from behind the veils, and they may come forth from beyond the praises, and they may recognize the one who came to them from the side of the remaining world with a clear sovereignty. And you, oh that letter, first purify yourself, then purify people from the stain of the greatest event with this purest abundance that we have made flow from the sources of meanings so that you may be a messenger from us to all creation. Be sincere to Allah your Lord in such a way that no one will find any scent from you except His. Thus, the tongue of truth commands you: if you listen to the advice of your Lord, Allah will flow the water of life from your mouth and revive every dry bone with it. In this way, We have graced you again, so that you may be among those who cut off.</p>
<p>All praise is to the one who recognizes his Master in this clear and luminous shirt.</p>
