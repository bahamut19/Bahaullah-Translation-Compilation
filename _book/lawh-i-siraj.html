<p>He is the Answerer</p>
<section id="sarrajs-question-to-bahaullah" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sarrajs-question-to-bahaullah">Sarraj’s Question to Baha’u’llah</h2>
<p>The letter of that esteemed person is present in the presence of the Throne and has reached the place where “None can be known besides Him,” and what is in it is noted in the gaze of God. The question posed concerned how the Letters of ’Illiyyín could transform into the Letters of Sijjín, how affirmation could revert to negation, how the fruit of paradise could be barred from refinement, or how the mirror could be deprived of the illuminating rays of the sun of meanings.</p>
<p>Thou hast asked well, and thou art among those who question with sincere intention. Thy question is praiseworthy, for in this day it is imperative that anyone unable to grasp the mysteries of divine questions seek and aspire from the shore of divine knowledge and the ocean of the wisdom of the Eternal, hoping that a droplet from it might satiate him, that he might rest in the abode of calm and certitude.</p>
<p>We beseech God to raise thee to the station where thou canst witness the beauty of the Ancient with thine own sight, separate from the vision of others. That thou might hear His melodies with thine own ears, away from the hearts of those in the heavens and the earth. That He may purify thee from the filth of the world and its distractions so that wherever thou passest, thou hearest the proclamation, “There is none other God but Him!” The Radiant Countenance, in its splendor, is among the Hosts on high. Its brilliance shines between the earth and the heavens, and its grandeur is evident to those in the Kingdom of command and creation. Every being utters thus if thou art among those who listen.</p>
<p>Today it is incumbent upon every soul, from God, to observe with their eyes, ears, and hearts His Cause, to reflect, and to be enlightened and blessed by the radiant bounty of the Most Merciful and the grace of the Sublime One through the effulgence of the sun of meanings.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-people-are-unable-to-attain-the-presence-of-god" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-people-are-unable-to-attain-the-presence-of-god">Why People Are Unable to Attain the Presence of God</h2>
<p>The cause that has deprived all people of attaining the presence of God and preoccupied them with what is other than Him is that they have sufficed with mere illusions, content with what they have heard from others. They have walked the deadly paths of imitation and have been deprived of the avenues of detachment.</p>
<p>The Cause of God has been like the bright morning light. If some remain veiled from understanding it, it is because they have polluted their ears and hearts with the impurities of the words of men. Otherwise, if one looks at the true measure of divine knowledge, they will never be deprived of the path of guidance.</p>
<p>Now, esteemed one, consider: the matter has two aspects. Either the people of the Bayán acknowledge the power of God, or they do not. If they do not acknowledge it, then we have nothing to say to such souls, as they are among the former religions who consider “the hand of God is chained.” As the Lord of Majesty has informed us in His words:</p>
<section id="reason-1-the-hand-of-god-is-chained" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-1-the-hand-of-god-is-chained">Reason 1: The Hand of God is Chained</h3>
<p>“The hand of God is chained.” If they acknowledge the wondrous power of the Divine Lord, then being bound to such trivial matters would be futile and void, for helplessness is inherent to created beings while the Everlasting Essence remains ever upon the Throne of power and might. Should He so will, with a single word He could raise all the inhabitants of the earth to the heavens of His Cause or by another word lower them to the lowest state. No one can question His actions, and whoever does so denies God, turns away from His power, and fights against His authority.</p>
<p>In His holy scriptures, He also possesses the ability to raise any manifestation of His self among people whenever He wills. In the moment of His appearance, one should seek proof and evidence only from Him. If He provides the proof that has always been the means of confirming God’s religion and establishing His Cause among humanity, then any delay would be fruitless. If all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth were to linger, even for an instant, in acknowledging this Cause, they would be among those who have turned away from God and be considered among those denied.</p>
<p>He elevates whom He wills and brings low whom He wills. “He is not to be questioned about what He does.”</p>
<p>Reflect with fairness. If a soul manifests the entirety of divine power and further provides the proof that has always established God’s religion and His Cause, yet a person turns away from this divine appearance and not only does this but actively seeks to slay Him, what should be the judgment against such a soul? Say: God’s judgment is that He passes as He wishes, and He rules with justice, though people do not perceive it.</p>
</section>
<section id="reason-2-the-appearance-of-god-should-not-occur" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-2-the-appearance-of-god-should-not-occur">Reason 2: The Appearance of God Should Not Occur</h3>
<p>At no time or in any religion has such an act been permissible. God is the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Should they claim that this appearance should not occur, as the idolaters claimed, this would make God’s power dependent on people’s will. “Exalted is He above this, by a great elevation!”</p>
<p>During the manifestation sixty, all people, learned and unlearned, deprived themselves of the Truth through baseless and empty words and have thus changed the exalted station of everlasting existence into the lowest degradation of non-existence. They imagine themselves to be securely seated at the highest station of faith. “Wretched is what they have thought to themselves!”</p>
<p>Now, lift thine eyes above everything else and gaze upon the truth to behold what appears from Him. All besides Him is nothingness and shall remain so. If, today, all who are in the heavens and on the earth were to embody the Letters of the Bayán—a hundred thousand times greater than the Letters of the Qur’án—yet were to linger in this Cause, they would still be counted among those who have turned away from God. God, the Exalted and Almighty, is not likened, connected, or comparable to anyone. He remains sanctified above all others.</p>
<p>The radiance of the Sun of Grace shines equally upon all things, and all in creation are gathered before His grace, standing in a single plane. Not one particle has superiority over another, except in their priority of knowing and attaining God. Blessed are those who know Him by themselves and sever themselves from all besides Him.</p>
<p>O ’Alí, listen to the call of God and enter into His court, which is ever sanctified from names so that thou mayest not be deprived of the Countenance of His beauty or the sovereignty of the one who, by His will, created the Kingdom of names.</p>
<p>By God, besides whom there is no other, our intent with these words is to enable thee and a few others to tear away the veil and enter the sacred pavilion of the Beloved, sanctified from the suspicions and imaginations of humankind. Otherwise, He is exalted above their acceptance or rejection, and is independent of the world.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-3-the-sun-causes-stars-to-lose-their-light">Reason 3: The Sun Causes Stars to Lose Their Light</h3>
<p>When the sun shines, is it fitting for someone to ask how the stars lose their light, while observing that the light of the sun has rendered their illumination void? Yet, the stars prefer the darkness of night, avoiding the light of day, for their brightness is visible only at night. They vanish under the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>Glorified is He beyond all comparisons. His Sun of Beauty has always shone forth, with none beside Him. All besides Him are created upon this earthly plane and return to Him. He is ever-exalted, above all, and will ever remain so.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-4-bewilderment-by-the-changes-of-names">Reason 4: Bewilderment By the Changes of Names</h3>
<p>It is astonishing that people are bewildered by the changes of the names, despite seeing, with their own eyes, the changes in the manifestations and dawning-places of these divine names and attributes. They remain veiled by illusions and false words, unaware of the truths they see before their very eyes.</p>
<p>O questioner, do not imagine the names and attributes of God. Know that everything between the earth and the heavens are manifestations of His names and dawning-places of His attributes. Humanity was created with a higher rank than everything else.</p>
<p>Reflect on all these manifestations of divine names, trees, branches, blossoms, fruits, flowers, and everything adorning the face of the earth. In the beginning, they appear in full freshness and beauty. After some time, they all return to the earth. Many delectable fruits change so that their very scent becomes unbearable.</p>
<p>However, all change and elevation are exceptions for the comprehensive manifestations of God, who remain eternally present. The Sun of Meanings testifies that God speaks according to the understanding of the people.</p>
<p>Listen, if you wish, to these words and cast away the wings of imitation. Instead, with the wings of detachment, soar in the air of this holy unity. Listen attentively to the words of the All-Merciful, so that the heart may be purified from the dusty illusions that have beset all of creation. Thus will one return to the greatest vision.</p>
<p>When reaching this sacred and pure station, one will see that what is meant by the Bayán, which descended from the heaven of the previous manifestation, is this very appearance. “By Him in whose grasp is the soul of Husayn,” nothing greater than this Cause has been revealed in the Bayán. Consider this with clear and penetrating vision so that thou mayest comprehend the intent of the sacred divine words. In all writings and tablets, He has advised all people and taken a covenant from them that, upon the appearance of the Manifestation, they should not cling to that which is created and become veiled from the Manifestation itself. “For on that day, nothing will benefit except by His permission.”</p>

<p>“And wait for the one who reminds you of God through his countenance. For you were created only for meeting Him, and He is the one who has connected everything to His command. Beware, beware in the days of His appearance lest you be veiled by the singularity of the Bayán, for that singularity is a created thing in His sight. Beware, beware lest you be veiled by the words revealed in the Bayán, for they are the words of His own self in the structure of His previous appearance.</p>
<p>Now, reflect on these words of the Sovereign of Names and Attributes. Do these firm verses and perfect words leave any room for anyone to turn away? “By Him who has caused the spirit to speak within my breast,” except for those who fully turn away from the Truth. The Bayán is the initial creation, and all beneath them were created in their shadow.</p>
<p>Vahíd Akbar also states, ‘And perhaps the one for whom you asked, regarding the exaltation of his name and the elevation of his Cause, will come to you. Those in the Bayán will read those words and will not turn to his appearance or believe in the God who created them in His previous manifestation. They slumber still.’”</p>

<p>As is evident now, everyone reads the Book of God and writes about it day and night, yet no one has truly sensed even a single letter from it. Their sole intention in promoting the Book is the establishment of authority and proving their own leadership. The Tongue of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing bears witness to this.</p>
<p>He says: “From the beginning of that matter until before the completion of nine created realities, nothing was revealed. From the sperm to that which We clothed with flesh, then be patient until you witness another creation.” Say, “Blessed be God, the best of creators!”</p>
<p>In another verse, He says: “This is what We promised you before. Be patient until the Bayán fulfills nine.” If so, say, “Blessed be God, the best of innovators!” He further declares: “Be observant of the distinction between the Qá’im and the Qayyúm. In the ninth year, all good things will be attained.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-distinction-between-the-qaim-and-the-qayyum">The Distinction Between the Qa’im and the Qayyum</h3>
<p>Now, reflect on these words and on the distinction between the Qá’im and the Qayyúm. I cannot explain these divine words due to the sorrows that have befallen me. By God, besides whom there is no other, I was compelled to write this tablet for the proclamation of God’s Cause, hoping that a few lamps might be illuminated and stand firm in aiding this wronged one by God’s power. “Everything weeps over my affliction and the injustice brought upon me by those who were created by My Word.”</p>
<p>Despite all this, I must still provide proofs for a Cause that has always been sanctified from requiring evidence, so that a few might ascend to the heavens of recognition. No greater injustice exists than to require the Ancient Beauty to prove His own legitimacy after His appearance is already clear as the noonday sun.</p>
<p>Soon will those who have wronged the Self of God realize the end to which they shall return. The calamities have reached such an extent that none but God can recount them. At every moment, the spears of enmity from adversaries pierce the eternal frame.</p>
<p>“The manifestations of the Self of God came to me this morning, weeping and wailing. They said, ‘Alas, for Joseph of God, the Mighty, the Everlasting! His servants have cast Him into the pit, and they rejoice within themselves.’ Say: ‘O people of the Bayán, do you kill the First Point while you read His verses morning and evening?’ By God, you have done what no nation has done before, and honored servants bear witness to this. Do you kill God with the swords of self and desire, yet continue to remember Him from your pulpits and use His verses to prove your point?”</p>
<p>Thus has every nation treated God when He appeared in the manifestation of His Self. They have done and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Say: “Today, the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Qayyúm, will not move on behalf of these names. The eye of God will not return to them, nor will the breaths of the Beloved’s holiness touch them.”</p>
<p>If the servants turn away from these divine verses and manifestations of the All-Sufficing, by what proof will they establish their religion? Say: “O people of the Bayán, observe with the sight of truth the greatest vision, for with any lesser sight, it cannot be seen.”</p>
<p>The Previous Manifestation said: “Beware! Look upon Him with His own eye. Whoever looks upon Him with another’s eye will never recognize Him.” After innumerable counsels, He tells His servants in this Cause: “O my God, You know that I have not withheld my counsel from these people nor failed to lead them to God, their Lord, and to faith in God, their Creator.”</p>
<section id="the-soul-of-bahaullah-was-the-babs-sacrifice" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-soul-of-bahaullah-was-the-babs-sacrifice">The Soul of Baha’u’llah Was the Bab’s Sacrifice</h4>
<p>My soul is His sacrifice. By the beauty of the Eternal, these words from the Pen of the All-Merciful have set the hearts of all things ablaze, and anyone with vision will lament and grieve the manifestation of the Names and Attributes. But the wrongdoers gain only delusion and loss.</p>
<p>O ’Alí, open the ears of your heart and listen to the words of the All-Merciful revealed in the Qayyúm of Names. He says: “O Light of My Eye, do not fully open your hand over the Cause, for people are drunk on the mystery. Yet, your return will occur after this cycle through the Greater Truth. Then, reveal a mystery according to the eye of a needle in the Greater Mount, so that those of the Mount will perish in the Sinai at the rising of a drop from that crimson light.”</p>
<p>In this verse, He shows that the people of the Mount will die and be nothing. How then can one marvel when the fruit of the Tree of Bliss turns bitter, just as was asked about the transformation of the realities of ’Illiyyín to Sijjín?</p>
<p>The Cause of God is not and will not be confined. If the mirrors of creation stand before the sun of the Ancient Heaven at the time of its rising, the rays of the sun will appear, imprint, and manifest in them all. But if they turn away, they will be left deprived. “Gaze upon the sun and then at the mirrors to find the path to that which the spirit brings.”</p>

<section id="verses-by-ibn-nabil" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verses-by-ibn-nabil">Verses by Ibn Nabil</h3>
<p>Ibn Nabíl has written proofs of God’s Cause based on what God has placed in his heart. He began by citing the verse that descended from the will of the previous Manifestation: “Say: ‘O God, You are the God of gods. You bestow divinity upon whom You will and strip it from whom You will.’” And: “Say: ‘O God, You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth. You bestow lordship upon whom You will and remove it from whom You will.’”</p>
<p>Even though the Sovereign of existence clearly declared that divinity and lordship are bestowed upon anyone He wills, and taken from anyone He wishes, is not God, who can grant or remove the highest stations of divinity and lordship, able to take His own name from a form or transform something sweet into bitter? “Exalted is God above what the people imagine about His power!”</p>
<p>Look and see where the bird of power and majesty flies, and where people have made their abode. How do they interpret the verse, ‘He is capable of all things,’ and understand the phrase, ‘He does as He wills and is not questioned’?</p>
<p>O servants, detach yourselves from the flimsiest of houses and seek the dawn of divine knowledge. I wish the people of the Bayán would reflect on the blessed verse mentioned by Ibn Nabíl. Perhaps they would abandon paths of illusion and tread the path of certainty.</p>
<p>O ’Alí, drink from this sweet, life-giving water hidden in the dark expressions of the Sovereign of Names and Attributes, so that you may purify yourself from the defilements of the days, illusions of the people, hints of the heedless, and arguments of the fanatical. Then, the infinite doors of divine knowledge will open to your heart. You will become assured that the Sovereign of Eternity is capable of honoring all beings in an instant with the robes of divine names and stripping them of it in another instant.</p>
<p>“I complain to God about these people, for they look upon me based on what they have rather than what I have. They compare the Self of God to their selves and His words to their words.”</p>
<p>By Him in whose grasp is my soul, if today everyone in the heavens and on earth were to turn to God, He would teach them from the wonders of His knowledge and enrich them from everything besides Him.</p>
<p>In this year of trials, some servants have asked such questions. I wrote firm, clear, and sufficient answers, but it seems that you have not seen them. Some have spread doubts here, attempting to veil holy souls with words from previous revelations. However, they forget that a soul soaring in the vast air of divine holiness and reaping from the fields of infinite divine knowledge is not veiled by imaginary doubts.</p>
<p>“Say: ‘Whoever arrives at the greatest sea will not turn to the mirage of a desert or drink from the boiling waters.’” Although it is not fitting for the Supreme Pen to mention the words of those who harbor enmity or to respond, I am compelled to fulfill the messages of the Lord, hoping that an ignorant one may reach the sea of knowledge or that a wanderer lost in the valleys of heedlessness may be guided by the grace of the All-Merciful. “Indeed, He guides whom He wills to the path of glory.”</p>
<p>This mention and explanation are only for those truly seeking the path of guidance. Otherwise, the contaminated spring cannot purify a heart filled with hatred.</p>
<p>Most of the people of the Bayán have seen and heard all the divine manifestations of power and revealed verses, yet they arise in hatred to such an extent that one cannot mention it. “Except for the one whom God has opened his vision and aided in His Cause.”</p>

<p>They cling to matters that were never mentioned before God and are so heedless that they prostrate themselves before a stone while turning away from the greatest vision and the most luminous, pure beauty.</p>
<p>“By the Lord worshipped by His servants, a hair from a true worshipper is better than them.”</p>
<p>O ’Alí, say today: “You and your objects of worship are equal before God. Whoever among you believes has been saved from the great terror, and whoever turns away has strayed from the path of God. This is the truth, and after the truth is only error.”</p>
<p>“Beware, beware, O people of the Bayán, do not deny God or fight against the Manifestation of His Self. Do not dispute with the one who came from the dawn of the Cause with clear authority.”</p>
<p>Do you believe that God’s Cause will be hindered by those who reject it, or that the lights of the eternal sun will be veiled by the clouds of dark souls? By Him who spoke within me, nothing can prevent His Cause, and He sent me with the truth to the people.</p>
<p>Some idolaters have spread the false idea that gold cannot turn to copper. Say: “By my Lord, we have knowledge of this and teach whom we wish through our own knowledge. Whoever is in doubt should ask God to witness it and be among the convinced.”</p>
<p>If copper is able to reach the station of gold, it is clear proof that gold can return to its original state if people understood. All metals share similarities in weight, shape, and matter, but knowledge of this remains hidden within the Book.</p>
<p>The knowledge of those who reject this Cause has not reached the station that allows them to comprehend that gold can turn into copper, nor have they grasped that all metals can become dust. Every person of understanding knows that all things emerge from dust and return to dust, which is cheaper than copper. Dust is an element, while copper is a substance.</p>
<p>Had the people been receptive and mature, some of these hidden divine sciences would have been revealed. However, fate has been decreed.</p>
<p>It is clear to every discerning soul that God, exalted be His mention, has been and will continue to be capable of all things. He can turn gold into copper by His mere will. Weakness is present in the created, yet He is the All-Powerful, Mighty, Praised One.</p>
<p>Purify your gaze and focus on the greatest vision. Detach yourself from barren trees that neither enrich nor bear fruit. This is among the wondrous commands of God. “Whoever wishes may accept, and whoever wishes may turn away. Whoever accepts does so for himself, and whoever turns away harms only himself.”</p>
<p>“He is sanctified above all people.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, consider the Ancient House (Kaaba), the sacred shrine of all creation, which was circumambulated by the manifestations of the Names and Attributes. Why was it deprived of this supreme bounty? Reflect, O people of insight.</p>
<p>All things are in the grasp of the divine power, and at every moment, He can bring forth whatever He wishes. His encompassing might is never taken from the manifestations of existence. His hidden mysteries cannot be understood by every ear, nor can His intellectual maidens be observed by every eye.</p>

<p>How many forms of tyranny have been clothed in the garb of justice, and how many just truths have been wrongly known in garments of oppression? Look at the idols before whom half the people of the earth now prostrate themselves and take as gods other than God. They have been afflicted with this ailment because they relied on imagination and imitation while turning away from the Sovereign of Unity.</p>
<p>Today, the manifestations of all Names and Attributes are evident in one station, except for those who ascend to God. Thus do We reveal to you so that you may cleanse yourself from the words of the people and hear the melodies of the Spirit on the branches of this tree that surrounds all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Say, O people of the Bayán, by God, the True One, this has not come from Myself but from what God spoke within My heart. What has appeared from My authority and what has flowed from My pen are My proof and My argument if you are just.</p>
<p>Say, by what proof did you believe in ’Alí before, when He appeared with the truth and came to you with clear authority? By what evidence did you confirm His verses, submit to His proof, and humble yourselves at the appearances of His mighty, exalted, and illuminating Cause?</p>
<p>If you say, “We believed in Him by Himself and sufficed with His own proof,” then say: “By God, He now stands before humanity, appearing with the authority of His name, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Great.”</p>
<p>If you say, “We believed in what was revealed to Him from the verses of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful,” then those verses have filled the earth from east to west.</p>
<p>Listen to what is revealed from the holy direction, where one hears its breeze as did the Beloved on the Ascension of Holiness, the Spirit in the Heavens of the Cause, and Moses on the Mount of Might, when the Tree of God, the Speaking, Mighty, Wise One, called out.</p>

<p>By God, they hid behind the veils of women. When the Cause appeared with its authority, they were reassured and came out of hiding. But their first action was to turn away from the One by whom their faith was confirmed. Thus was the matter, and you are a witness.</p>
<p>If you do not believe Me after what you have seen with your eyes, then all things will testify to Me, followed by the Tongue of God, the Truthful, Trustworthy One.</p>
<p>O Glory of Majesty, change the melody for those of creation. Sing on the branches of eternity in a mighty, non-Arabic tone to reveal the secrets of the Cause through what has been written by this firm, unyielding pen. Not all people are familiar with the Arabic tongue, and understanding Persian is easier for them.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformation-from-illiyim-to-sijjin">Transformation from Illiyim to Sijjin</h3>
<p>O questioner, all the names you see in the Book of God, such as the Tree of Bliss, the Lote-Tree of the Limit, the Ultimate Tree, and its leaves and fruits, are not imaginary. They signify those who believe in God and will continue to do so. As long as the believer resides under the shade of the Divine Tree, they are counted among the Tree of Bliss and ’Illiyyín before God.</p>
<p>However, after turning away from the Tree, they are mentioned among the fires of Sijjín. While faithful, their branches, leaves, and fruits are evident as signs of affirmation. But after turning away, they are all regarded as symbols of negation.</p>
<p>There is a soul that is rooted in the Tree of Eternity during the evening but remains by the lowest tree of annihilation at dawn. Conversely, the opposite is true if you understand. Observe a believer in the state of devotion to God like a well-adorned paradise, filled with what you have heard about in paradise: branches of knowledge, fruits of divine insight, streams of eloquence, and flowers of wisdom. Above all this, according to God’s will, everything will be found in it.</p>
<p>The same soul, after turning away, becomes the self of hell, along with all that was connected to it. Thus does God transform light into darkness and darkness into light if you comprehend.</p>
<p>“Have you not heard that the previous Manifestation established this law on the earth? He declared that any land where no believer resides is counted as an inferno. Now, the throne of the earth has been placed upon a land that was previously unknown. However, those who hate the Beauty of the Lord of the Worlds have deprived themselves of the heights of ’Illiyyín and have settled in the depths of Sijjín, thinking themselves to be in the highest place in paradise. Previous religions were also occupied with these illusions.</p>
<p>“The Pen of the Cause gives them the good news of the torment of an inauspicious day. These people are content to take calves other than God and prostrate themselves before them, but they are not worthy of soaring in the holy air of the Eternal or returning to the heavens of divine glory. The one whose nature has turned to clay is always drawn to it.</p>
<p>“God presents this as an example so that people may comprehend.”</p>
<p>Have you not heard that He says, “Many a tree of affirmation becomes a tree of denial in the next Manifestation”? Today, any soul that does not sever itself from all that is seen among people and recognize it as mere clay will never be able to soar in this atmosphere or ascend to the abode of the sovereign glory of holiness.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="believers-have-always-been-rare">Believers Have Always Been Rare</h3>
<p>Believers have always been fewer than the rare red sulfur. The suns of meanings have shone from the horizons of the divine finger. The fruit does not exist in itself but is lifted from the earthly realm by divine assistance, reaching this station where it may become fruitful. That One who granted this station by His power can, in less than a moment, cause it and a hundred thousand like it to descend from the highest station of permanence to the lowest station of extinction, and vice versa. This has always been and will always be His way.</p>
<p>His encompassing power and predestined decrees have forever prevailed over all things. His appearances are never hindered by the weakest of illusions. “Glorified is God above what those who imagine think.”</p>
<p>Many pearls of mystery are hidden within the shells of the seas of the Lord, the Concealer’s names. Their revelation would lead to the stumbling of those not on the straight path.</p>
<p>Today, a bounty has appeared such that if He wills, He can raise the primal and ultimate letters from a handful of clay. Yet, it is a great pity if a person in this day, when the Beauty of the All-Merciful has fully manifested, occupies themselves with anything but Him.</p>
<p>“Leave all who are in the heavens and on the earth to their own, then immerse yourself in the depths of this ocean, where nothing is found but the pearls of the remembrance of your Lord, the Exalted, the All-Powerful, the Great.”</p>
<p>This is the wondrous appearance of the Sun of the All-Merciful’s Cause shining from the horizon of the King of the Possible’s finger. Blessed are the people of the world!</p>
<p>Beyond that, “your Lord is free from all people.””</p>
<p>Many souls today are drowning in the seas of fire without realizing it, yet believe themselves to be among the people of paradise. The previous communities have also rejoiced in such illusions.</p>
<p>“By the Sun of Glory of the Sanctified,” this appearance is too great to need proof or depend on arguments. “Say: Its proof is its appearance, its argument is itself, and its existence is its affirmation. Its argument is its establishment between the heavens and the earth during the days when all those in the Kingdom of command and creation were disturbed.”</p>
<p>If you cannot recognize it based on what has been explained to you, then recognize it by what has been revealed from Him. “Thus has been given to you a bounty from Him. He is the Generous, the Ancient.”</p>
<p>“The Supreme Pen says: ‘O ’Alí, step once upon the Mount of Holiness with a pure heart and tongue. Say, “O Lord, show me,” so that you may forever witness and hear the One beyond compare and attain to the Presence of the Glorious One. That is, meeting the Manifestation of His Self, so that a single ray of the lights of His grace will cause the trees of existence to sing from the seen and unseen with what the Lote Tree of the Mount has proclaimed.’ Thus has the grace of the Sovereign encompassed, and people are in a great illusion and thick veil.”</p>

<p>This is the state of those who always pride themselves on the Word of Truth yet turn away from His Self. They circumambulate a stone and travel the difficult paths from far places, giving up their wealth and lives to visit it. But they turn away from the Sovereign by whose Word hundreds of thousands of these stones are created.</p>
<p>In the sixtieth year, and again in these days, they veil the clear sight with a hundred thousand veils of illusion and veils of self. Then they cry out that the shining sun of eternal glory has not risen. If they understand, they ask how such a star can be erased or extinguished, yet forget that the sun’s light removes the stars’ light. In the daytime, the stars’ light is obliterated and unseen.</p>
<p>“Soon, the divine hand of encompassing power will create souls that will tear all veils and enter the sacred sanctuary of the Lord of Lords without any cover or screen.”</p>
<p>They will not be quenched by any water or falter before any fire on the path of the Beloved. They will regard all besides the Worshipped One as non-existent and see everything but their Goal as void. At all times, they will drag the people of creation to the Most Merciful’s garden with chains of explanation.</p>
<p>“By the Sun of Meanings, the light of these souls will illuminate the hosts on high, just as the sun shines upon the people of the earth.</p>
<p>‘O ’Alí, leave what you have and take what God commands you. This will suffice you over all people, and anything else neither satisfies nor enriches.’</p>
<p>Hold fast to the strongest handle and leave what desire commands you. “By God, the True One, this is the firm rope between the earth and the sky. Whoever holds to it will be saved, and whoever turns away will perish.”</p>
<p>If any soul seeks the exalted Truth besides Him, it is like a blind person seeking guidance on the path. “This will never happen. His proof is His verses and His authority is His affirmation.”</p>
<p>’O ’Alí, listen to the divine words in the beautiful Persian language. If you do not listen, God’s encompassing power will create souls to hear His call and rise to aid His Cause. “This is not difficult for God.”</p>
<p>If you return from the north of illusion to the right of certainty and are nourished by the fountain of knowledge of the All-Merciful’s Beauty that flows in the paradise of meanings, say, “O people of the Bayán, what religion are you practicing, and upon which path do you stand?”</p>
<p>If they say, “We are devoted to the Point of the Bayán,” ask them what proof or evidence led them to be certain of and confess to that Sovereign. If they say, “We know Him by Himself,” then this is an open lie because they have not yet known themselves, let alone the Self of God that stands over all things.</p>
<p>And if this saying is heard from them, why then do they not acknowledge the manifest Self of God, who is as radiant as the sun? If they say they believe in the revealed verses, why have they rejected the verses that are like a pouring downpour descending continuously from the unseen sky?</p>
<p>“Say, do you believe in part of the Book and deny the other part? Woe unto you, you people of injustice!”</p>
<p>Beyond these two stations, there are the manifestations of power and the aspects of divinity that encompass the world so thoroughly that no one can deny them except by completely rejecting God, His prophets, His chosen ones, and His friends.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty years have passed without this servant ever resting peacefully, and at all times, He has worked to raise the Cause of God. “By the Sovereign that none know, since the beginning of creation until now, no such power has appeared that a single soul has raised the banners of greatness and majesty.</p>
<p>Even so, the idolaters have done to the Manifest Beauty of the Lord of the Worlds what now causes the Holy Spirit to lament and wail in the heavenly forms of ’Illiyyín. If they say these wondrous verses did not descend from the divine nature, just as the idolaters have said about the suns of truth, say, “the tablets that have been revealed from the clouds…”</p>

<section id="signs-of-the-manifestation-of-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="signs-of-the-manifestation-of-god">Signs of the Manifestation of God</h3>
<p>The Exalted Lord of the Worlds’ glory was revealed in the sixtieth year, and these wondrous verses have descended from the highest realm of sanctity and are present. They are recited before a number of pure-hearted souls with sharp vision, virtuous spirits, and attentive ears. From the words, one can sense the melodies of God and the sacred fragrances wafting from His unique utterances. By the truth of God, the scent of one of these words carries the fragrance of God, the Protector, the Everlasting. Yet all people are afflicted with spiritual illness, and none can perceive this unless the Beloved, Almighty Lord, wills it.</p>
<p>Despite the rejection by those who oppose and slander, which has reached the point where both the pen and speech fall silent, we still nourish the people from the divine, eternal, and sacred table of knowledge for God’s sake. We desire neither reward nor gratitude from them. By Him who spoke within my breast, none of the previous religions are cloaked with the veils of the people of the Bayán. In all prior scriptures, the mention of the manifestations of the One God was recorded indirectly. For instance, in the Torah, it was stated in some places that if a person claims to be a prophet, they are a liar, for there is no god but the God of Moses, and no messenger but Moses will be sent. The divine laws are only as revealed in the Torah.</p>
<p>In some instances, the Torah alluded indirectly to a future revelation, but it was expressed in such obscure terms that most people have been unable to grasp it. If His followers are veiled from the dawns of the One and the divine manifestations, they could find some excuse to claim they could not comprehend the divine words and were thus deprived of the fountain of divine knowledge.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Gospel, the Holy Spirit has alluded to the signs of the Manifestation in such veiled language that only those detached from all else can understand it. These references were recorded by the firm Pen in the Persian epistles. Study them to find the truth. In this case, if these people say that their minds couldn’t grasp the mysterious and challenging words, some people may accept this excuse.</p>
<p>In the Qur’an, you have seen the challenging expressions used to describe the signs of the Manifestation. For example: “On the day when God comes in the shadows of the clouds,” “On the day when the sky brings forth a clear smoke,” “When the sky is torn asunder,” “When the earth is split apart,” “When mountains are crumbled to dust,” “When the seas overflow,” “When the dead rise from their graves,” “When the trumpet is blown,” “When the sun rises from the west,” “When a cry is heard between the heavens and the earth,” and similar expressions.</p>
<p>All these words, including the explicit phrase “Seal of the Prophets,” are considered the decisive words of the Qur’an. With such challenging and intricate terms, if people are veiled from the divine law and knowledge of His Self in the next life, it could be argued that they have not understood the divine words and were unaware of the meanings of the divine words.</p>
<p>Although this may not be near to people’s understanding, none of these excuses are acceptable at the time of the Manifestation because the Manifestation itself and what is revealed from Him serve as the proof that is evident to all creation. Every soul must purify the mirror of their heart from everything people possess. After purification and turning toward Him, the light of the Manifestation’s sun will undoubtedly shine upon their hearts.</p>
<p>If God’s proof isn’t sufficient at the time of the Manifestation, no one would be held accountable. For example, among the people of the Qur’an, any soul that did not purify its heart from the insinuations of words did not attain the recognition of the Point of the Bayán, because the mention of finality is one of the decisive words of the Qur’an. With this concept affirmed and the apparent meaning in people’s hearts, it would never allow them to admit that a prophet has always been and will always be present, as stated in the Bayán: “Purify your hearts from what you have witnessed so that you may witness what no one in the world has seen.”</p>
<p>During the Manifestation, one must turn away from all things and focus on God alone, for without this, no one will ever attain God, the Exalted, the Great.</p>
<p>O servants of desire, listen to the sacred melodies of eternity and hasten to the place of “Know God by God” and sever yourselves from all else.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-babs-explanations-are-clear">The Bab’s Explanations Are Clear</h2>
<p>The Point of the Bayán—may the souls of all names be sacrificed for Him—raised all these statements and tore away the veils, explaining all these challenging words by His Manifestation and what He revealed. He mentioned this appearance of divine glory in a way that left no room for hesitation, let alone rejection. He connected the entire Bayán and all it contains to knowing that everlasting sun of divine glory.</p>
<p>“Do not cling to the Bayán in the moment of His Manifestation and be veiled by its words, thus being deprived of the sovereignty of the One.”</p>
<p>He particularly addresses the letters and mirrors: “You have used my words as proof. Beware that in the hour of His appearance, you do not act arrogantly toward the chosen Beauty.”</p>
<p>While He promises the rising of the sun of truth in the “Most-Invoked,” He declares that if it appears at another hour, no one has the right to ask why or how. The Sovereign of the possible has always been and will always be free to choose. Whoever claims otherwise denies the Exalted One’s freedom. We seek refuge in the True One from such false assumptions.</p>
<p>He has removed all limits and veils from this station. That Eternal Beauty is forever sanctified from all limits and allusion, and none have ever and will ever know the nature of His appearance. “None can encompass His knowledge, and He knows all things.”</p>
<p>He says, “From the moment the sun of glory rises until it sets, it is better in God’s Book than the whole night. Do you understand? Nothing was created except for that day, when all work to attain God’s presence and pleasure.”</p>
<p>And He says, “Noontime is near, and you are the day itself without realizing it. Whoever seeks meeting Me, his meeting is like meeting My own Self. Do not be content with anything for him that I would not accept for Myself.”</p>
<p>O ear of existence, whose hearing is not evident! Listen to the decisive words of the Lord, which explicitly and without interpretation foretold that during those days, the sun will rise and soon shine fully at its zenith. But you, O people of the Bayán, will not recognize that radiant divine Beauty on that day. He also made clear reference to this name with the words, “From the moment the sun of glory rises until it sets, it is better in God’s Book than the whole night,” to ensure that no one doubts and interprets anything apart from what God has decreed.</p>
<p>Despite this, all remain veiled by their own selves and desires and cannot perceive the sun of glory, instead clinging to what Satan has commanded. Would that they only remained veiled! But some have gone further, distorting these words that reflect the Names and Attributes. This is an injustice that has never been surpassed since the beginning of creation. Woe to the unjust from the torment of a tremendous day!</p>
<section id="some-mirrors-have-claimed-the-station-of-the-sun" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-mirrors-have-claimed-the-station-of-the-sun">Some Mirrors Have Claimed the Station of the Sun</h3>
<p>After the appearance of this sun of eternal majesty, some mirrors have imagined themselves and claimed the station of the sun. But they are heedless of the fact that the Persian Bayán explicitly states that if a mirror claims to be the sun, the sun knows it is merely a shadow speaking.</p>
<p>It is also said that mirrors have no independent existence of their own. Elsewhere, it is declared, “Say: O suns of the mirrors, you are looking toward the sun of truth, and your existence depends on it if you perceive. You all move like fish in the ocean yet remain veiled from the water and ask about that which sustains you.”</p>
<p>Consider that He speaks to the suns of the mirrors, which are the primary mirrors, saying that they should look toward the sun of truth, as their existence and manifestation have always been by its grace. He likens these suns of the mirrors to fish in water, moving in the ocean but veiled from the sea and its water. Similarly, today we see that the mirrors of the people swim in the ocean of divine verses, affirming themselves through the mighty verses of the Eternal, revealed in the previous manifestation. Their movement and expression come from the verses of God, yet they remain entirely veiled from the essence of the verses and their source in these days. They swim in the sea while being oblivious to the lord of the ocean.</p>
<p>This statement is made concerning the suns of the mirrors in the Kingdom of Eternity, let alone those mirrors that are below these suns. He says, “On the day of His appearance, the highest among creation is like the lowest, and the nearest to you will believe in Him. There is no kinship or superiority among you except by your faith in Him.”</p>
<p>Thus, today we witness that the highest of creation is mentioned alongside the lowest before God. How many manifestations of ’Illiyyín have returned to Sijjín, and how many dawning-places of “No” have entered the station of the manifestation of “Yes.”</p>
<p>He also says to the honorable Áqá Sayyid Jawád: “I will be grateful to you, O mirror, for abandoning all other mirrors. Let them all, in their different forms, look toward Me.”</p>
<p>Observe that He complains about all the mirrors, yet this Beauty gives thanks to the one renowned as a mirror because he looks toward Me with what he has, not with what I possess.</p>
<p>In this passage, it’s emphasized that even if all mirrors are known by names of divinity, lordship, or even the Self of God in the Bayán, it isn’t enough unless they recognize the sacred manifestation of this divine appearance and the concealed mystery of the Eternal. Otherwise, in God’s eyes, they are mere nothingness and utter void.</p>

<section id="dont-let-the-bayan-be-a-veil" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-let-the-bayan-be-a-veil">Don’t Let the Bayan Be A Veil</h3>
<p>As was recorded at the beginning of these tablets by the Pen of God, it was said, “Beware, beware, on the day of His appearance, that you do not become veiled by the Unity of the Bayán, for that Unity is a creation in His sight. And beware, beware, that you do not become veiled by the words revealed in the Bayán, for they are His own words in the structure of His previous appearance.”</p>
<p>This warns that, at the time of the Manifestation, do not let the Unity of the Bayán obscure you from the Manifestation of the Cause. This Unity refers to those souls who were not preceded by anyone after the Point of the Bayán. Nonetheless, He advises not to be veiled by these souls from the Truth. It is implied that some of these letters will remain in the subsequent Manifestation.</p>
<p>He also cautions not to become veiled by what has been revealed in the Bayán from the Truth.</p>
<p>Be just, O people of the Bayán. Can anyone today contend with the Manifestation Himself, claiming that someone named in the Bayán as the Name of God cannot be stripped of their rank today? No, by Him who strengthened the spirit with My soul, these names, mentions, and descriptions are, at best, mere words inscribed in the Bayán. One of the eternal Sovereign’s counsels is not to be veiled from the Manifestation of God by what was revealed in the Bayán.</p>
<p>Moreover, by the sun of majestic glory shining forth from the sacred horizon, He declares that the mention of the Eternal Sovereign sees no distinction between the created in the Bayán, whether under lordship or servitude. Even in a stone, which is inanimate, He indicated three of the greatest divine names within its three letters, to remind people to recognize these names in it so that through the created, they can see the signs of the Creator. The one who gave such ranks to a stone is rightfully able to remove them, and no one has the right to object to God’s matter. “By God, none shall object to God’s matter but the wicked and the sinful.”</p>
</section>
<section id="the-revival-of-names" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-revival-of-names">The Revival of Names</h3>
<p>If people understood the revival of the names, they would never object to the Sovereign who does as He wills. Some are raised by the names and known in the kingdom of names, but their essence has never risen from the depths of self and desire. There is wisdom unknown but to God and renown without foundation.</p>
<p>Some are raised by their essence without the name. You have heard the story of Khidr, whose lofty station was known to none but God. Even Moses, despite his high station, was unaware of him until he came into his presence and was addressed:</p>
<p>“Indeed, you will never be able to bear with me,” was the address to him. Although he is mentioned in the book by the name of Khidr, no one truly knew him except God, and with us is his knowledge in a clear book.</p>
<p>Some are raised by their essence, being, self, spirit, and name. Bear witness and say, “Glory be to God, the best of creators!” If the stages of resurrection are fully explained, it would become evident what station and rank those who boast of the names hold. Nevertheless, we hold the pen until God wills, and He clarifies all matters in a clear book.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all things are repositories of divine names and stores of mysteries of craftsmanship. In every era, He brings forth from each thing whatever He wills and takes away whatever He wishes.</p>
<p>It is surprising that today, the Beauty of the Eternal and the sun of the Greatest Name shines brightly at its zenith, yet people are deprived of the light of beauty and knowledge of the incomparable Countenance of the Lord because of a mere name. Say: By the truth of God, by the will of His pen, the oceans and realms of names were created if you comprehend. If He were to take a handful of dust today and raise from it any name, He could do so, for He is the Sovereign, the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>By God, the eyes of prophets and messengers weep for Me in the highest companionship. They mourn within themselves and cry out in their very beings, but people are in a deep state of heedlessness.</p>
<p>The people of the Bayán have declined to the extent that the Tongue of the All-Merciful had to utter such words, yet they still refuse to accept. This is the state of these people. Today, any soul that does not ascend beyond the kingdom of names will never attain this greatest bounty.</p>
<p>This is why the Point of the Bayán says that the embryo of the next Manifestation will be stronger than all the people of the Bayán. Reflect on this, O people of insight. By Him who stands by Himself, if people consider this single word, they would see themselves as independent of all besides God. They would not need to prove or question this wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>“God speaks the truth, yet people do not listen.”</p>

<p>He also says, “His likeness is like the sun. If countless mirrors face it, all will reflect the light of the sun within their own limits. But if none face it, the sun rises and sets, and the veil is upon the mirrors.”</p>
<p>Consider from this sacred statement that the sun can rise and set while the mirrors remain veiled. Even after the Sun of Suns rises and countless suns orbit around it, unknown in number to any but God, the All-Knowing, how can a mirror be deprived of the sun’s light and radiance?</p>
<p>It is clear that the mirrors do not have their own existence; they shine only by the presence of the sun. Today, if all the mirrors of creation face the majestic sun of the Eternal, all will reflect its light. But if they deviate, they become nothing and vanish.</p>
<p>Observe a physical mirror: as long as it faces the sun, the reflection is evident, but if it turns away, the reflection disappears. He also says that He is that sovereign who, if He acts, by a single utterance creates whatever He desires, whether a prophet, saint, or truthful one.</p>
<p>Is it fitting to turn away from such a powerful sovereign, by whose word prophets and saints are created, and instead cling to a name, phrase, or mirror? This is a great injustice. By God, they have committed a deed that none have done before: after the sun appeared at its zenith, there should be no hesitation for any soul.</p>
<p>If a person cannot directly recognize Him and finds themselves incapable of perceiving the Eternal Beauty, let them seek evidence as all servants did, to confirm their faith. If the Sun reveals the proof from the oceans of its generosity and grace, how can any remain doubtful unless they wholly reject the Truth and find refuge in Sijjín and the fire of denial?</p>
<p>Many souls today believe themselves secure on the high seat of faith and the throne of certainty but are utterly estranged from the Truth, drowning in the sea of disbelief and continuously suffering torment, unaware of it. If only rejection and denial sufficed!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mirza-yahyas-actions-against-bahaullah">Mirza Yahya’s Actions Against Baha’u’llah</h3>
<p>By Him who causes Me to praise Himself, this is never enough. A soul that was raised and taught by Me with the words of the All-Merciful has risen against Me, fought with Me, turned away from My Beauty, disputed God’s verses, and endeavored to cut down the tree of divinity.</p>
<p>When his actions were revealed, he conspired so cunningly that no one but God, the Mighty, the Powerful, can count them all. He fabricated accusations and spread them far and wide. The pen cannot record them all. He attributed to the Self of God all the evils that have ever been, yet remains firmly in his position, confident in the ignorance of people who walk the paths of illusion and swim in the sea of imitation.</p>
<p>By Him in whose grasp My soul rests, if he had the slightest vision, he would not have done such things. But soon, from behind the veil of divine protection, souls will appear with eyes that can distinguish truth from falsehood, the sun from its shadow. No obstacle will prevent them from the straight path, nor any barrier deprive them of the mighty news.</p>
<p>Would that one with insight looks upon their words, which reveal their selves and beings, to recognize them and be among those who know.</p>
<p>By the Greatest Sovereign, if one examines the words of the rejectors with clear vision, they would understand the rank and station of these illusory souls. Today, the leaders of the Bayán argue with the same proofs that the lowest among the people of the Qur’an use to defend their own reality, unaware of it.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guardianship-was-entirely-removed-from-the-book">Guardianship Was Entirely Removed From The Book</h3>
<p>For instance, the principle of guardianship (Imamate) was entirely removed from the Book by the previous Manifestation. All are aware that nothing but letters and mirrors descended from the Pen of the All-Merciful in the Bayán. The mirrors were not limited either, as the invocations state: “O my God, send continually pure and clear mirrors to reflect You and guide people to You.” All tablets reveal: “Whoever wills, let them observe and be among those who know.”</p>
<p>The people of the Qur’an have made a final seal of the prophets and remain veiled from the sender and the message. Similarly, these companions intend to establish a final seal of guardianship for themselves. They cast into the pit of hatred the One who created hundreds of thousands of saints by His Word and at all times cast the stones of suspicion from every direction upon His blessed being. Within themselves, they cry out and claim to be oppressed, trying to instill the chains of God in the weak.</p>
<p>Such is the state of the mirrors that have appeared. Say: “If God decrees that the most despised of names among people is your Lord, or vice versa, none can ask why or how, for He decrees what He wills and is not to be questioned. He is the powerful, mighty one.”</p>
<p>These days, they have written and circulated letters refuting the Truth with hands of idolatry. By the Sun of Meanings, their words are like the meaningless babble of children, utterly insignificant if you recognize.</p>
<p>Compare the writings and letters of this group with those from the servants of this house, and be just that you may not be deprived of the ocean of meanings that encompasses all things. Truth has descended to the extent that people from all around ask about matters of the Qur’an and demand written answers.</p>

<section id="how-a-mirror-descends-from-the-station-of-mirrorness" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-a-mirror-descends-from-the-station-of-mirrorness">How A Mirror Descends From the Station of Mirrorness</h3>
<p>For instance, one considers a mirror as a ruby and then asks how the ruby can change its station and how it changes after attaining this station. The mirror might change before reaching the station of mirrorness, but after reaching it, how can it descend?</p>
<p>First, say, “O questioner, we ask God to grant you success and enable you to recognize each thing in its station, to be detached from all illusions, and see only the manifestation of the lights that encompass all the world. Remove from your heart all other mentions and focus on praising your mighty, chosen Lord.”</p>
<p>“In a day like this, it is not fitting for anyone to pay attention to anything between the heavens and the earth. Should a person, after the sun has shone at its zenith, be preoccupied with the stars or inquire about a lamp even if it shines brightly? No, look toward the radiant, sacred, exalted, and luminous face of God. Leave all other mentions behind and hold to this word that appeared with truth and speaks in everything: ‘There is none but I, the mighty, the wise.’”</p>
<p>If you cannot succeed in what has been revealed in these verses from the heaven of the One and still seek the answer to your question, listen to the call of the Most Glorious from the horizon of the Highest Majesty. First, know that all things change into other things and that knowledge of this is recorded in the Book of your Lord, who never errs nor forgets.</p>
<p>Second, if someone asks whether God can change a ruby, what will you answer? Inability has always been a trait of the created, while the Exalted One stands in the zenith of power and can, by a single word, make all on earth into pieces of pure ruby or reduce all to stone.</p>
<p>“Exalted is He above what you have imagined of His power!”</p>
<p>Put a ruby in the fire and see what happens, so that you may be certain of the transformation of all things in God’s sight. Similarly, the ruby of the heart that falls into the fire of ego and desire will certainly lose its clarity and beauty.</p>
<p>Today, many pieces of ruby have turned to stone, unaware of it. Conversely, the opposite can occur if you understand.</p>
</section>
<section id="detachment-to-be-free-and-independent" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="detachment-to-be-free-and-independent">Detachment To Be Free and Independent</h3>
<p>O people, listen to the call of the bird of eternity from the highest paradise and drink the purest nectar from the sacred fingers of glory. Detach yourselves from all besides God to be free and independent, that the oceans of divine knowledge and wisdom may flow from your heart and tongue, and you may be sanctified and above such matters.</p>
<p>Do not stain your heart, the deposit of the chosen Beauty, with the impurity of the words of the immoral and the doubts of the evil, for today they appear with every trick and deceit. They cast doubt into the heart however they can.</p>
<p>Beyond all these statements, if there is anything in the world that does not transform or change, what relevance does this have to the concerns of these people? For instance, if the ruby does not change, what relevance does this have to one who turns toward the truth and one who turns away, or the difference between a monotheist and a polytheist?</p>
<p>In some things, the Sovereign of Names has allowed transformation, while in others, He has not. For example, copper can become gold, but dust cannot. This was previously noted by scholars, so this servant did not wish to go into detail.</p>
<p>However, in humans, the potential for knowledge, ignorance, acceptance, rejection, belief, and disbelief is evident and apparent. If the questioner refers to gold and ruby in the mineral realm, that is far removed from the intended purpose, for even if gold does not become copper and ruby does not turn to ash, this cannot be used to generalize all other created things.</p>
<p>This is clear to those who see with the greatest vision. If it concerns humanity, gold and ruby symbolize the believer and their faith in God, and this has always transformed. Many servants have attained faith when the Beauty of the All-Merciful appeared but later turned away.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="all-things-constantly-transform-in-gods-sight">All Things Constantly Transform in God’s Sight</h3>
<p>If you rise from the realm of illusion and purify your heart from allusions, you will see all things constantly transforming in God’s sight.</p>
<p>Whoever has been granted this vision is among those with insight before the mighty, chosen one. The essence of the Point of Mercy is that the Cause of God has always been sanctified above mention, description, and limitation.</p>
<p>Whoever seeks to comprehend the Sovereign of All within these veils will never succeed. By the power of the Sovereign of Eternity, tear through the veils of the names and beyond, and enter the city that is mightier, more secure, more exalted, and more holy.</p>
<p>“The hour has drawn near, and the moon is split.” If anyone asks about this verse, say, “O you who examine words, leave the numbers aside and consider the verse itself. Today, if all those in the heavens and on earth reflect on this blessed verse and ponder its hidden meanings, it will suffice for all.”</p>
<p>Today, the inner sun has risen from the visible horizon of the verse, serving as a sharp sword against those who have taken protectors other than God. The meaning of this verse did not become evident until this lofty Manifestation, for in the appearance of the First Point, there was no guardian by people’s assumptions to be split, but there were scholars. Scholars were likened to stars, the guardian to the moon, and the prophet to the sun.</p>
<p>In this Manifestation, the sun has risen from the horizon of God, and the moon of illusion has been split. Say, “Blessed be God, the most capable of all!”</p>
<p>Reflect upon this revealed verse and be just. “Do not be among those who recognize the bounty of God and then deny it.”</p>
<p>If only these people understood the guardian and mirror they have taken other than God! By the sun of majestic glory, what they heard about the mirror was never as they thought. Anyone who claims knowledge against the Lord of Eternity is lying. What this servant has disclosed due to God’s wisdom has become known among the people, but no one has fully comprehended the intent of the words of the First Point. For His own wise purpose, this servant has concealed the essence of the matter from all.</p>
<p>“By God, He created what He made in the world with a breath from Himself in a way no one else ever has.”</p>
<p>If people observed any one of the wondrous tablets that have descended from the heaven of eternal glory with the sight of God, they would not be veiled from the truth and would regard everything else as nothing. They would be assured that everything besides Him is unmentioned and always will be, let alone those who turn away.</p>

<section id="infallibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="infallibility">Infallibility</h3>
<p>Today, some have claimed the infallibility of others apart from God, much like the people of the Qur’an spoke without understanding. They never grasped the meaning of infallibility. True infallibility is evident today: any soul who, after hearing the words of God and His call, affirms with “Yes!” is considered among the infallible, and those who do not are excluded from infallibility.</p>
<p>The Point of the Bayán—may all besides Him be a sacrifice for Him—says, addressing the Great One, “The Cause has transcended limits. You have purified servants who, when God revealed Himself to them, recognized God, their Creator. They did not waver and never doubted, so I made them like those I had made before: prophets, successors, martyrs, and the nearest.</p>
<p>By my life, if you attend in numbers like all things, I will make them, and nothing will diminish or increase God’s dominion. However, you see that the highest degree requires supreme infallibility, and infallibility is not what people think—it’s not about their caution in religion.</p>
<p>“When they heard the call, ‘Am I not your Lord?’ they did not respond ‘Yes!’ And God did not address anyone except through the Manifestation of His Self in every Manifestation.”</p>
<p>After this statement, which is the clearest of all words revealed by the Pen of God, who else can establish their infallibility except through acceptance of this greatest, most exalted Cause? Today, all people, regardless of their rank, are outside infallibility except those souls who have accepted this sacred, eternal Manifestation.</p>
<p>O servants of God, listen to the call of God and let your ears be freed from the words of the people of the Qur’an so that you may perceive the wondrous language of the All-Merciful in the Bayán. Reflect upon this: in what statement have these groups been truthful?</p>
</section>
<section id="muslims-relied-on-false-traditions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="muslims-relied-on-false-traditions">Muslims Relied on False Traditions</h3>
<p>For 1,260 years, they insisted on the seal of prophethood, claimed that the Qa’im would appear in a specific form in a particular land, and cited thousands of signs of his appearance. They relied on these traditions to such an extent that anyone denying them was considered an infidel. However, in the appearance of the Point of the Bayán—exalted be His mention—it became clear that they were all mistaken, and the Manifestations of the Sovereign Majesty have always risen and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>In other statements, too, these misleading forms were all illusions and will remain so. Their deity is their own desire, and their object of worship is their illusions, if you understand. Even though all the people of the Bayán have seen that everything in the hands of this group was false, they still rely on the words of the people of the Qur’an for arguments.</p>
<p>Just now, this group is using the concept of guardianship to try to prevent people from accessing the heavenly Euphrates and the sacred path of the eternal Majesty. By the beauty of God, the exalted, the sublime, even if a thousand Manifestations were present during the appearance of the Point of the Bayán, and if one of them hesitated for a moment in their affirmation of the Sovereign King, they would be counted among the people of the fire.</p>
<p>Tear through the veils of illusion and return to the exalted heaven of Glory. If you want the truth to be evident to all, let a few fair-minded people come to this city, observe the works and words of God, and compare them with the claims of the adversaries who are also present in this land. Inquire with precision so that the evidence of truth becomes clear, and everyone will realize that everything besides Him is poor at His gate, powerless in His presence, and lost before the appearance of His lights.</p>

<section id="those-named-in-the-bayan" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="those-named-in-the-bayan">Those Named in the Bayan</h3>
<p>In the Persian Bayán, the divine tongue said: “He has made every effort so that, on the day of the Manifestation of Truth, His words cannot be used against Him, for all the Bayán is the word of His previous Manifestation. He is more knowledgeable than all He revealed to creation because the spirit of all is in His grasp and not in anyone else’s.”</p>
<p>Consider this statement of the Beauty of the All-Merciful. Despite having clearly prohibited all from arguing against that Essence of existence, the pure Beloved, and explicitly stating not to use the words of the Bayán against its Manifestation in the next appearance, today we see that many are rising in opposition. They argue that certain individuals were named in the Bayán with beautiful titles and ask how they can be demoted from their position.</p>
<p>Furthermore, He says: “Recognize Him by His verses, and do not be cautious in your recognition of Him, for by such caution you will end up in the fire.”</p>
<p>In light of these decisive words, all those who are cautious in this sacred, exalted Cause are surely in the fire; there is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>And He says: “If you look between yourself and God, you will find His likeness in your hearts. Do not be veiled from Him by His own self and recognize the One for whose recognition you were created.”</p>
<p>He also says: “At every Manifestation of the Tree of Truth, the believers in His Book and Himself become veiled from His previous Manifestation and His subsequent Book, leaving none but the pure believers, who are more precious than the philosopher’s stone.”</p>
<p>Today, all have been tested, and most people have turned away from the Sovereign of Oneness. They say that certain individuals were named in the Bayán with the name of God, and with such statements, they have been deprived of the Eternal Glory, failing to realize the impact of their own actions. Even if one accepts these claims, they remain unaware that all names are united at that sacred horizon, where He grants as He wills and takes as He pleases.</p>
<p>He declares, “Who knows the manifestation except God? Whenever He appears, all must accept the Point of Truth and thank God.”</p>
<p>Yet, some have opposed this near Manifestation, just as the previous nations were also occupied with opposition. Say: “Woe to you! How swiftly you have exchanged God’s bounty and trodden the path of illusion and error.”</p>
<p>It is not long since the Manifestation appeared, yet they have already returned to their old ways. Nevertheless, the Truth has always been free to choose and will remain so, appearing however He desires. He is the Sovereign, while all else is in His grasp.</p>
<p>By Him in whose hand my soul rests, there is no greater injustice today than the One who speaks in everything, “I am God; there is no God but Me,” having to prove to His servants that He can change a name of His own. The Kingdom of Names bows to His authority, the might of attributes trembles in fear of Him, and the divinity of mysteries submits to His presence, created by His will. It began by His command and returns to Him.</p>
<p>Such is the state of these immature and unprepared souls. The Mighty One, by whose will all names were created and all attributes revealed, around whom the people of the Most Exalted Realm circle, should not need to prove that He can take away a name from someone. They remain ignorant of this name, yet they doubt the power of the Sovereign who does as He wills. They have considered the hand of this wondrous and supreme Manifestation to be chained, even if they do not explicitly admit this.</p>
<p>His chosen Tongue bears witness against them, even as they deny it. He says: “To the people, these are but words, for they never understood Your intention, which is why they remain veiled today from Your Manifestation.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aqa-sayyid-husayn-was-ignored">Aqa Sayyid Husayn Was Ignored</h3>
<p>Today, everyone has remained veiled from the Manifestation by the words of the Bayán, despite not understanding or ever comprehending God’s purpose. That Eternal Beauty instructed the leaders of the Bayán to ask the “Living Letter” directly about God’s purpose in His words because they could not discern God’s intention on their own. The “Living Letter” was Áqá Sayyid Husayn, who gave his life for God, his Lord. No one attained his presence to inquire about the meanings of the divine words.</p>
<p>The purpose of this statement, as the Tongue of the All-Merciful has said, is for the leaders to recognize that they were never and are not now aware of the meanings of God’s words. As the Manifestation was near, Sayyid Husayn ascended to the highest station. Reflect upon this, O people of insight.</p>
<p>He says, “Everything I have mentioned to you as evidence is but a drop from the vast ocean of the apparent. If you desire the heart’s mystery through the authority of the inner Countenance, no allusion can point to it, nor can any veil obscure it to its furthest limit. None requires a reason to know it, for it is the Manifestation itself and the essence of the hidden. Exalted is God above what they ascribe.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-hatred-towards-god">The Hatred Towards God</h3>
<p>The Beauty of that Countenance declares that no path can lead to the sacred realm of the Eternal Glory, as a mark of reverence for His presence and a reflection of the purity of His essence and the subtlety of His being. Yet, after revealing the sun of His own Beauty from the horizon of Eternity in all divine manifestations and every attribute of oneness, they have cast arrows of hatred from every direction at the clear Beauty of the Lord of all creation.</p>
<p>“The first one to attack Me was the one I sheltered beneath the wings of My bounty. I nurtured him under My robe and taught him in My days. He was the one who killed Me with the sword of rejection, shed My blood, and desecrated the sanctity of God within Me. He denied My verses after he had humbled himself before just one of them and was created by a breath of it. He rejected God’s right in My right, fought against God’s Self in My Self, and issued a verdict for My death outwardly. When God prevented him by His authority and revealed the secrets of his heart to those who had migrated in God’s path, he then resorted to fabrications and attributed his actions and cruelty to My wronged Self, confident in those who followed him.”</p>
<p>“By God, the heavens of the Cause were rent asunder by his actions, the lands of holiness were split by his cruelty, and the veils of the Kingdom were torn by his words. The inhabitants of the cities of Eternity wept at his injustice, while he laughed within himself as if he had committed nothing in the kingdom. By God, everything weeps, yet he remains unaware. Soon he will learn when death approaches, and his eyes will spin from the force of the wrath. He will say, ‘Can I return to seek forgiveness for what I have done?’ Then, the clay of perdition will be sealed upon his mouth, and thus it is decreed for the arrogant against God, the Mighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>“Exalted are You, O my God. If You declare that You have forgiven the Bayán and those within it, then all are in Your pardon and good pleasure. But if You say otherwise, then I grasp the hem of Your bounty and intercede with You by Your very Self.”</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the Eternal Essence only speaks through the tongue of the Manifestation of His Self. Observe in those statements the depth of humility exhibited by the Beloved of all creation, as He ties the entire Bayán and everything in it to the favors of the Eternal Sovereign in the next Manifestation.</p>
<p>Now, the Sovereign of the unseen and seen is manifest to all. He has been so afflicted that even if all the oceans of the unseen and seen became ink, every being in the kingdom became pens, and everyone in the heavens and on earth became scribes, they would still fail to describe it. If only they had counted themselves among the faithful. “The curse of God be upon the wrongdoers and the idolaters!”</p>
<p>Yet they continue to read and transcribe the Bayán. How many recite the Bayán while the Bayán curses them! How many act according to it, while their deeds reject them! How many mention it while its words flee from them!</p>
<p>“May God protect us and you, O people of the monotheists, from these individuals and their evil, deception, and cunning.”</p>
<p>In the prayer, “O Sovereign of Names and Attributes,” it is stated:</p>
<p>“I ask You, O my God, by Your independence from all things, to accept the Bayán and all who are within it. I have named everything that appeared from Me after that name and made it all a book and a leaf of the gardens toward You. If You accept it, my Beloved, that is from the appearance of Your grace and mercy. If You reject it, my Beloved, that is from the appearance of Your justice and the independence of Your Lordship.”</p>

<p>Considering that all declarations were bound by that Sublime Essence and Radiant Mercy, they are now preoccupied with the most inferior of creation and deprived of His beauty. Woe unto them, and again woe unto them. By God, these people do not pass by anything without it seeking refuge with God from them, disassociating itself, and in the voice of its inner truth, it says, “O heedless idolater, by what argument did you believe in the manifestation of ’Ali before Nabil, and by what proof did you disbelieve in Hussein before ’Ali? No, you accursed one, by God, you never truly believed in any of God’s messengers before, and if you had believed in that time of belief, it would not have been a true belief, but only a semblance. If it had been genuine, you would not have disbelieved in Him who fulfilled the message of every messenger and the sending of every prophet, and the faith of all in the heavens and on earth.”</p>
<p>These forceful words are translated into the purest contemporary Persian for the sake of God, hoping that souls might be purified from the impurities of self and desire, and ascend to the heaven of divine recognition, where God guides whom He wills to His sacred and luminous beauty. Today, anyone who turns away from the true countenance of God does not pass by anything without that thing, in the voice of its inner truth, saying: “O idolater, by what proof and argument have you believed in the Beauty of the Merciful in the previous manifestation, and by what evidence have you disbelieved in the Sovereign Path in this manifestation?”</p>
<p>By the sanctity of the eternal Sun, you have always been a disbeliever and idolater. If you professed faith in any era, it was not out of sincerity but merely a shadow within you. In this manifestation, faith has been seized, and the devil has returned to its place in the lowest of the hell. If your faith had been real, you would not have disbelieved in the one with whom the sending of all messengers and the faith of everything in the heavens and on earth has been affirmed.</p>

<p>O servants of God, with a pure heart and a gaze of fairness, consider the divine matter, lest you be deprived of the holy sanctuary and barred from the Kaaba of divine recognition. O ’Ali, although you are the questioner and the answers are inscribed in your name, it seems very difficult that today you will concede to the truth and be mindful of all that is written in the tablet, for your heart has been veiled by thick veils, and your sight obscured by infinite waves. Yet, the glance of God and His moments are secretly directed at other hearts in these words, and soon, by His power, they will appear, making everything other than God visible in its shadow. However, the mention of your name has descended by the precedence of divine mercy and the encompassing of divine grace, perhaps to catch you in the breezes of the days of God and sever you from the peoples. This statement, lofty and solid, has been inscribed by the pen of grace, lest you throw stones of suspicion at the divine Lote-Tree and not deprive the servants of the law of the Lord of creation in these severe days.</p>
<p>They say all mirrors and narrators reflect the sun according to their rank and the degree of the sun’s manifestation in that mirror at that time, and it is by this that everyone existing and evident by the sun argues. If the sign of the sun’s manifestation, which has been made apparent in the mirror by the mirror itself, is removed, nothing remains in the mirror to indicate its creator and illuminator. And with these solid, unambiguous, lofty words, the people of declaration have doubted how a mirror can be deprived of the manifestation of the sun’s lights and have paused at this rank, the mention of which is not possible. And on any individual who objects after the sun of beauty has dawned at the zenith of decline, saying, “What is the light and proof of this?” O uninformed ones, rise from the sleep of neglect and observe His lights which have encompassed the world. Some say it has dawned too soon; O visionless ones, whether it is near or far, now that it has dawned, observe whether this dawn is indeed true. The rest is in your hands, and this servant has never been and will never be divine wisdom hidden from the view of creation, necessitating such.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bahaullah-revealed-himself-not-by-his-will">Baha’u’llah Revealed Himself Not By His Will</h3>
<p>O people, accept what God has pleased for you and decreed for you. By God, if the matter were in my hands, I would never reveal myself. O those who harbor malice, I swear by the sun of eternal existence that if the matter were up to this servant, I would never make myself known, for the name mentioned is disgraced by the mention of these impure, deceitful tongues. And whenever I have been still and chosen silence, the Holy Spirit has spoken from my right, the Greatest Spirit from before my face, the Trusted Spirit above my head, and the Spirit of Glory in my breast, and if you listen with a subtle ear, from all my members, viscera, veins, and even my nails, you would hear the call of God, even from my hairs, that there is no god but He, and that this beauty is for His beauty in the heavens and on earth.</p>
<p>If this were my sin, by God, it is not from me but from Him who sent me and commissioned me with the truth and made me a lamp for the worlds. O people, the scent of truth is very clear and distinguishable from falsehood. Do not impose on the truth what you would not accept for yourselves. Reflect a bit on what this servant’s purpose has been in these last days in this great prison. Reflect, O people of inattention. O people, be ashamed before God and do not complain about His matter and do not ask for proof of the sun and its shining, for its proof is its light and its rays, and you should not doubt its appearance, for it has shone, and there is no denying it. Rather, ask God to open your sight to perceive its lights that have encompassed the two worlds.</p>
<p>Say by God, the pen of holiness has inscribed on my white forehead with the most splendid line, “O people of the earth and the heavens, this is indeed the Beloved who has never been seen by the eye of creation nor resembled by the eye of invention, and He is indeed the one by whose beauty the eye of God, the King, the Powerful, the Beautiful, has been gratified.”</p>
<p>This is an old story, that a page of the Torah was in the hands of one of the companions of the Messenger of God. The Presence asked, “What do you have in your hand?” He presented the Torah, and the Presence said, “Put it down. If the owner thereof had obeyed me, now consider the book of God that the matter of all, from the prophet to the letters and the mirrors and the pillars, has been affirmed and confirmed. Taking it and reading it should not be forbidden, but rather, changing one of the mirrors, as you suppose, that has been realized by the letters, that these letters have been established and confirmed by the book, should not be permissible.”</p>
<p>Woe unto you who say what you do not perceive and think yourselves guided as the religions before you thought and thereby rejoiced. By God, there is no protector for anyone from the matter of God except by severing himself from everything in the heavens and on earth and turning to God, the Sustainer, the Everlasting. Make your sight pure so that today you may see all things in one place and observe the lights of the sanctified sun from the horizon of the shirt with both the outward and inward sight, and beyond all these proofs.</p>

<section id="guidance-and-praise-for-mirza-asadullah" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="guidance-and-praise-for-mirza-asadullah">Guidance and Praise for Mirza Asadullah</h3>
<p>In Mirza Asadullah, to whom the First Point addressed, saying, “O Manifestation of Oneness, what do you say?” Now give justice, how can one who is the place of appearance of the sovereign Oneness be called the father of evils, and if you say, “This status has been denied by a mirror,” assuming that it is permissible, then if a soul accepts the point of the shirt from a mirror among mirrors, what intentions does that ancient beauty have, and if you say, how is it established that this point is visible and that the comprehensive word in its claim is truthful, we say with the same argument and proof that you have accepted everything that appeared from Him and descended from Him in the previous appearance.</p>
<p>Now look with the same argument and proof and do not disbelieve in God who created you by His command if you are among the fair-minded, and likewise, to Mirza Asadullah, it is said, “O third letter, the believer in whom God reveals,” and in the Jafariyah epistle, which specifically descended from the names of His essence at the beginning of the epistle, it is written, “This is the form of what descended for the Presence of the Lion, the Unique, the Eastern Radiant with the Light of the Absolute, the name of God, the Just Judge, the One for God, the One relied upon,” and after it is said, “O name of the Just Judge, this hidden, stored knowledge we have entrusted to you and given you dignity from Us, for the eye of your heart is subtle, knows its value, and is honored by its glory,” and after it is said, “O name of the most noble, do not look at that truth except like sheep that its shepherd takes wherever he wishes.”</p>
<p>And beyond what is mentioned, the words of the Absolute Sanctuary that have descended in his description in the book are present, look at it, and this servant has not mentioned it in detail. O blind of existence, open your sight and consider your own illusion, for it is the same act you commit and by which you are currently perplexed and bewildered. As you call the Judge worldly and the Unique Father of Evils, who was among the greatest of God’s names, and despite that, you do not consider it permissible to change the divine power like your own power, and you consider the highest pen idle. I swear by my oppression that the pen of power is always busy erasing and affirming, and only those who are severed understand this, thus does the Merciful erase what He wishes and affirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>It is strange from these souls that boast with these names and have turned away from the truth. Indeed, these mentions and descriptions are present in every soul as long as they have not exited the fortress of God’s command, otherwise they have no value with God to the extent of the pupil of a dead ant’s eye. Beyond this, all things have been the mention of God in the worlds and will be, for all things by their existence have been the name of God. His name, may His glory be exalted, has been His mention among the servants, and it has always been so and will always be so, by He who chirps with glory and beauty. If it were not that the sight of God had seen creation as insufficient, I would certainly have opened in every atom of creation doors of knowledge that all creation would see themselves as incapable and deficient in recognizing it. Since others exist, secrets are hidden, thus has it been decreed by the Omnipotent, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Say, O people of declaration, you were created for My encounter after I was independent of you. You were promised by My soul and its recognition after I was independent of recognizing you. You were informed of My beauty after I was exalted above you and above what was created between the heavens and the earth, yet with the weakest of names today you cling, far and oblivious from the sovereign of names. If you look at the words, equivalent declarations from the sky of the Merciful have descended and appeared in a status that no one has the opportunity to turn away except the polytheists whose heart disease has prevented them from recognition and perception.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the words of the souls that today revolve around the matter of God, measure them with the words you have taken from God for yourselves as protectors, to be informed of the greatness of the matter, lest you hastily bring harm to the beauty of the ancient with mere illusion. I swear by the truth that the people of any nation from previous nations if they justify their veiling from the remaining manifestations of glory with inappropriate excuses, perhaps, but for the people of declaration, no excuse or justification remains, for the sovereign Oneness has stated the appearance after with the most explicit declaration and the clearest explanation, in a manner that binds all declaration. What has descended therein by His word, as it was written before by the pen of the ancient. Blessed are the knowers.</p>
<p>Among them in the denial of truth and the assertion of falsehood, turning away by God, they have clung to these words. Because it was not appropriate that their words be mentioned exactly, thus the pen of God did not move upon them. The content thereof is that it emanates from the pen of glory, your beloved was the owner of sight or not, if it is denied, the judgment of sight from the greater view is injustice upon God.</p>
<p>If that ancient sovereign was the owner of sight and knowledge, how can it be that a soul he described and mentioned with the most beautiful of names descends from its status and is counted among the deniers? Firstly, the proponent of this opinion did not know the right. May His glory be exalted, He does what He wills. They denied the encompassing divine power, and such a soul was and will be the farthest of servants.</p>
<p>By the text of the Point of Declaration, as previously mentioned, say, “O God, indeed You are the God of gods, that You give divinity to whom You will and indeed remove divinity from whom You will, to the end that You are capable of everything.” Say, “O God, indeed You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth, that You give lordship to whom You will and indeed remove lordship from whom You will to the end of what has descended.”</p>
<p>Now we say in this comprehensive word that has flowed from the innate nature of the sovereign Oneness, what do you say? If you have established the right, may His glory and majesty be exalted, the sovereign Omnipotent who is capable of granting divinity and lordship, the highest of statuses, to any soul He wills. Likewise, to take it from any soul He wishes, He is indeed capable of removing the garment of description from a soul. This mention is what everyone has said, without specifying anyone. If you look at the specification and consider the hand of God tied and deny the encompassing power, then what do you say about Mirza Asadullah, who is explicitly stated about him, “O third letter, the believer in whom God reveals.” This is very clear that the third letter whom God reveals, may His glory be glorified, is by a hundred thousand ranks higher than the letters of declaration and the mirrors thereof with God.</p>
<p>For the Point of Declaration itself, may my soul be sacrificed for Him, says, “the one-year-old seed of whom God reveals is stronger than all in the declaration.” Now give justice, was the Point of Declaration the owner of insight or not? If you consider him truthful and the owner of sight, why do you call a soul that has been exalted in the denial and ascension in the original book the father of evils and order his killing? O one-eyed, you have seen the faults of people and neglected what is in yourself. You say he turned away from the right, therefore this judgment was enacted upon him, assuming it is submitted, we say the third letter whom God reveals, which is more glorious and higher than the creation of the declaration with God by the text of the command pen. It is permissible that it be considered a denier, disbeliever, and polytheist, then why do you not consider it permissible that a mirror from the countless mirrors turn away from the right? So the one who disbelieved was confused, by God, no one is informed of the essence of this matter. If they were informed, they would recognize.</p>

<section id="christians-who-believe" class="level3">

<p>In the signature of the Greatest Single and the leaf of permanence, He sang in the most beautiful tunes: “O spirit for whom hears and is among those who reflect on the signs of God.” His statement, may His statement be glorified, by He who created the grain and originated the breath, He declares, “By the Almighty who cleaved the core of hearts and created humans, had I been certain that you would not believe in the next manifestation—the radiant sunrise of truth—I would surely have removed from you the decree of faith in this manifestation. You were created only to recognize that Sun of the sky of certitude. Should I know that one of the Christians would succeed in recognizing that beauty of the Merciful and believe in Him, I would indeed turn him into the apple of my eyes and decree his faith in this manifestation without needing to consider anything from him.”</p>
<p>Now, O people of insight, observe how much more delicate and finer is the matter of God, and how His expansive divine mercy has enveloped all existence. Regarding a person among the Christians who is currently an infidel and polytheist, merely through faith in the next manifestation, that divine sycamore has attributed him with gentleness and delicacy to His blessed limbs. These lowly people of the earth are unaware of what rank and observation they stand. Woe unto you, O people of heedlessness, for He who has made His own decree and sovereignty the proof of what flows from His enlightening pen. If all in the discourse today turn away, and one Christian believes, surely all names from the Preserved Tablet will be erased, and the name of the Christian will be affirmed. God erases what He wills and affirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.</p>
<p>Have they not heard the story of Balaam, hidden in the divine scriptures, who was one of the successors of the prophets before? All people of the world considered serving him a duty and his obedience as obedience to God. His name was renowned throughout the lands. But when the beauty of Moses appeared from the horizon of surrender, he stood in opposition to that divine beauty. Likewise, Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve apostles of the Gospel, handed over the Spirit to the Jews.</p>

<section id="blessings-for-the-steadfast" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blessings-for-the-steadfast">Blessings for the Steadfast</h3>
<p>Beware of divine trials and temptations; do not be complacent. Always seek refuge in the Almighty so that perhaps today you do not deviate from the clear path and slip. Blessed are those who remain steadfast, for the trial is for all and none are beyond His noose unless your Lord wills. If the breeze of His justice passes, you would see hundreds of thousands of jewels of light in the darkness of self and desire. If the breeze of His grace blows, you would see hundreds of thousands of ephemeral forms in the abode of the eternal throne.</p>
<p>By God, O people, you are not aware, and you move merely on illusion. Listen to the divine counsel and do not rush in the matter of God. Do not torment yourselves with endless torment, and do not occupy yourselves with the mirage of your own making while content with the shadow of the transient in place of the enduring glory of truth. Listen to the truth from the tongue of the Merciful. No one today is informed about the discourse and what is treasured within it, and its knowledge is with us if you are among the knowing. Do not be veiled by the shirt of names from the sovereign named, for all names are like shirts worn over whoever He wills out of His bounty and removed from whom He wills out of His justice. He is not questioned about what He does, and indeed, He is the Almighty, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>Today, most people of the discourse are mentioned as the servants of names before God, as if they were aware of the first point for themselves. By God, they would not have hesitated in this divine and majestic manifestation of the Merciful. Thus, it is evident that they were not aware of His glory and might, but knew Him by the shirt of His name. As days have not passed and they have appeared for themselves, they have not recognized Him, and they have imposed on Him what the pen is shy to mention. This lack of recognition occurred only because they changed the shirt, meaning the Highest Name was changed for the Most Glorious Name, and no one recognized it except those who were cut off from everything in the kingdom and ascended to God completely until they entered the abode of noble honor.</p>
<p>Those are My allies under the shade of My providence, and tranquility descends on them from My presence, and they are settled on the thrones of independence. Those whom God has protected from being targeted by doubts, and they recline on the sides of sanctity, looking toward both ends, upon them at all times are My glory, then My mercy and My providence, then My bounty and My favor. And thus God has chosen them for Himself and made them among the believers. O servants, strive so that perhaps you may enter the shade of the dome of the sun of divine providence from the heat of self and desire, and remain safe. These are the counsels of the pen of command; whoever listens, it is for himself, and whoever turns away, it is against him, and indeed, He is sanctified above the worlds.</p>
<p>Would that the adherents of the discourse, as inscribed in the Persian writings from the pen of the Merciful, looked with discernment. Perhaps then, in this divine manifestation, they would not deprive themselves of the flowing divine providence and the sublime courtesy of the divine. Yet, doubts have infiltrated impure hearts to such an extent that they fail to recognize their origins. If a heart is purified from the everlasting river of the enduring Sultan, free from doubt, it is immediately stained anew by another doubt. Sublime is God. Despite this, the people of the discourse themselves admit that prophethood ended with the Messenger of God and that the first sixty years mark the appearance of God. Nevertheless, they still invoke guardianship and similar concepts. They attempt to obscure the lights of the sun of certainty, which has risen in the everlasting sky of divine majesty.</p>
<p>Behold the days of appearance, and the truth is apparent like the sun at midday, with no adornments of the world present in its holy realm that necessitate an executor to divide it. Those who claim that His cause needs an executor are committing aggression against the Almighty, the Ever-Living. The matter revolves around Him and will never be separate from Him. Beware of attributing to God a minister, a counterpart, an adversary, a peer, an executor, a companion, or an example.</p>

<p>In elucidating these titles and the limits you have set for yourselves, all have been erased. This is why the mention of mirrors was revealed in the discourse before the Merciful, and they have not been, nor will they be, limited. We hope that the drizzles from the heaven of sanctity may shower upon the dusty and clouded hearts, so that they may pay attention to the manifest indications of the Master of Names and Attributes.</p>
<p>By God, O people, the purpose of mentioning these firm proofs, solid evidence, and unambiguous words was not to assert myself. For every soul that has achieved the slightest spiritual insight will undoubtedly observe the lights of the Most Glorious Sun, which manifest in everything as “There is no god but I, the Almighty, the All-Wise.”</p>
<p>Rather, my intention concerns those who will come in desperate times. By God, my pen, my fingertips, my eyes, my heart, my liver, my veins, my blood, my bones, and my skin all weep over what these deniers of God have brought upon themselves. They have fought against His essence, argued with His signs, denied His grace, and issued decrees against Him after all signs, proofs, and evidences have been made manifest. By God, you have done what no prior community has done; you have torn the garment of patience from the body of majesty. Yet, you walk upon the earth as if you bear no sin. Woe unto you, O assembly of polytheists!</p>
<p>By God, O people, falsehood has its odors, and so does truth—if only you would purify your hearts and your names and inhale, you would detect the fragrance of the Almighty, the Ever-Living. My pen is bewildered about what to mention next, now that the matter has reached a stage where my naive soul, if it were to become the subject of the Most High’s words, perceives itself as aggrieved. It should be preoccupied with the slightest of words, for how can a wolf become a shepherd?</p>

<p>Say, O impatient poor one, you have not recognized the shepherd, and for years wolves have been your shepherds, as you have realized after the divine light appeared from the spiritual heavens. You followed a people who were a hundred thousand times more worthy in the sight of God than those wolves because by their decree, the manifestation of the Lord of Lords was martyred in complete injustice. God’s curse be upon them and their followers. If you say that following those people was valid and acceptable to God before the appearance and that this people has since been counted among the fireside after the appearance, then apply the same rule now in this divine appearance.</p>
<p>Hear the divine counsel and purify your hearts from the hints of veiled words. Say, “O servants of passion, take a step towards God and soar from the land of suspicion to the air of certainty.” Now, O ancient pen, cease what you intended to remind the servants of God. Then, remember your brother who fought against you and argued with the signs of God. This remembrance is for the worlds, hoping that it might open the eyes of those who sought the face in the dusk and dawn. Their feet have not slipped on this day when the shank meets the shank.</p>
<p>By Him in whose hand is my soul, twenty years of earnest efforts and formidable endeavors were spent on his education, nurturing, and protection. These efforts are too numerous to recount. After migrating and entering this land, Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani left the house of God and the fortress of the seed and settled elsewhere. My brother, by God, there is no deity but He, aimed to sever the divine Lote-Tree. God revealed his inner secrets, and his deceit became well-known among the emigrants. The outcry rose among all, men and women, young and old.</p>
<p>I have completely isolated myself from everyone, hoping the heat of envy would cool and the fire of malice would subside. I have blocked all doors of exit and entry, and all the people of the sanctuary are preoccupied with mourning and lamentation. By God, no one can mention what has befallen us, nor can any of the lovers hear it.</p>
<p>At the time of departure, three were designated for service; two were specifically for my mentioned brother and Kalim, and one for myself. The few dirhams that came from the government were divided among us. Everyone then dispersed and settled in various places. Alone in my house, I sat with the door closed and the curtain drawn, never socializing with anyone, permanently sealing the door to encounters, and the beauty of permanence was hidden.</p>
<p>After Sayyid Muhammad’s beauty was concealed, my brother joined him. Hatred for God became the cause of their union; they engaged in deceit and intrigue. They deceived someone with a few dirhams to go to the lands and falsely attribute their actions to the divine command.</p>
<p>Much more could be detailed, but I find it inappropriate to dwell on these recollections. You have heard enough to express the necessity, so that people may not slip from the true path into falsehood. The commissioned soul eventually regretted and detailed the matters to some. When they saw the correspondences that accompanied him, all were bewildered because the actions they had undertaken were aligned with the truth.</p>
<p>They also wrote a treatise rejecting God, which they spread far and wide. By God, there is no deity but He, they spoke as if they were less than children. If only you knew. What they wrote in rejection of God was, in every positive aspect, sublime. If only people could see with God’s eyes in their words. How much slander they have attributed to the King of Names and Attributes, returning what was less than good to the essence of the divine tree.</p>
<p>I complain only of my grief and sadness to God. When the tongue of God speaks, it asks, “Is there any pure water to cleanse my surroundings from these deniers? Is there anyone of integrity to support me in these days surrounded by deniers? Is there anyone of detachment to recognize me with his own eyes and detach from all? Is there anyone with vision to look into my matter and what has come upon me from the armies of demons? Is there anyone with a tender, pure heart to weep with my weeping and over what has come upon me from these arrogant ones? Is there anyone with knowledge to fend off the hateful swords from the face of God, the King, the Almighty, the Beautiful?” O highest pen, say by God, the truth, I have not sought help from anyone when all religions fought with me, and God was witness and knowing to that. Whenever I sought help from anyone and commanded it to the servants, it was only to elevate them to the pinnacle of grace, and beyond that, indeed, God is rich and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Many letters have been written in refutation of the Sultan of Ahadiyya (Possible reference by Azalis for Baha’u’llah). By God, their actions have rendered their efforts null and misguided their endeavors in this world and the hereafter, and they do not perceive it. They have attributed the cause and reason for people’s rejection to this servant, including accusations of worldliness. It is evident to everyone of insight that this servant stood among the deniers like a shining sun. By the Beauty of Eternity, there was no morning where the night of comprehension could be perceived, nor any night where the dawn was expected to be seen. The polytheists, with utmost effort, attempted to cut the Divine Tree until the Sun of Power, the Hand of God above their hands, shone from the horizon of the Greatness’s pocket. The polytheists were defeated, and the Beauty, verily He is the Overcomer of all things, rose in power and might and moved from Iraq with full honor.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arrival-to-istanbul">Arrival to Istanbul</h3>
<p>It was known that the intention was to set out alone to Istanbul. However, due to the many cries and laments, some were granted permission to leave, and some left without permission until we arrived at the well-known land. Never did we express any request to the exalted government, and any soul that presented themselves before us was met; otherwise, not. As everyone has heard in the great city, the divine intention was what it was until some weak souls, for the sake of their own safety and their women, became agitated and alarmed. Thus, out of mercy for their souls, the command was issued. Now, which of these matters was related to worldliness?</p>
<p>They have judged according to their own selves, as their tongues have fabricated lies for them, saying what they do not perceive. God, there is no god but He, will cause the Pen to record what they have done. If there were any vision among them, the position and status of the deniers would be evident from the letters of those who wrote with ignorance and hatred. Two years ago, Mr.&nbsp;Muhammad Ali and Mr.&nbsp;Salman asked about a poem, and my brother replied. Later, Sayyid Isfahani mentioned that Mirza Ali did not grasp the meaning of the poem, and it was not appropriate to give this letter to Salman. This servant remained silent. Later, Haji Mirza Ahmad and my brother mentioned it in the house of the Hakim. After some ineffective words, my brother excused himself, suggesting that the questioner might have written the original poem incorrectly. Upon examining the poem, it was found to be correctly written, and that letter remains with Salman, as all have seen. No one became aware, for all are veiled by delusional barriers.</p>
<p>Observe to understand the extent of the deniers, yet they object to the Source of divine knowledge. By Him who has established the kingdom of predestination at His threshold, everything they have written is in this manner and will continue to be so, but eyes are blinded by the veils of delusion and desire. Therefore, they do not turn except those whom God has made their vision pure from the veil, and they look with keen sight into everything.</p>
<p>O servants, consider that the harm has reached such a degree that the Supreme Pen has become occupied with these words. Weak and immature people are observed, lest they be led astray by the fabricated words of the deniers and become heedless of the Manifest Beauty. Otherwise, if there were any degree of awareness and vision, the mention of the deniers and what has appeared from them would never be written. For today, all are obligated to observe the essence of the matter and what is manifested from it. Whoever ascends to that position witnesses that it is the radiant, brilliant, shining one in the midst of the sky, who decrees as He wills and is not questioned about what He desires. He is the powerful, the chosen one.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-charge-of-oppression-by-mirza-yahya-against-bahaullah">A Charge of Oppression by Mirza Yahya Against Baha’u’llah</h3>
<p>Among the accusations is the charge of oppression against this oppressed one. Reflect on this passage and be fair. All the people of the Bayan have met this servant and seen with their own eyes that I have never been pleased with harming anyone. By the Lord of the Throne, if you are just. The Breath of the Merciful has been in the mouth of the serpent for twenty years, yet it has never been revealed. Even now, if these fabricated writings had not been seen, they would never have been disclosed. This is testified by everyone who knows me and has clear insight. My brother was with this servant for twenty years, and no one was aware of him. Despite having power over him and knowing what was in his heart, utmost compassion was practiced towards him. This is testified by all things if you listen. However, because people were found to be followers and without insight, they have intended to prevent this group from the Ocean of Oceans with such words.</p>
<p>It is clear to all the people of the Bayan and others that this servant has not associated with anyone in this land, nor during the arrival in the great city, except those who presented themselves. My tongue has only spoken what elevates them to the Realm of Command. Despite this, they have written that among the people of the Sunnah, we have been called Rafidhis.</p>
<p>By God, there is no god but He, these rejecting souls themselves have attributed lack of faith to the Tree of the Merciful among the non-Arabs and among the people of the Sunnah and the community they have called us Rafidhis. Let a sincere soul come forward to determine the truth and falsehood. We set the measure of truth and falsehood by this statement when the Tongue of Eternity from His Greatest Throne calls out and says: “God curse the first oppressor who wronged the First Point in His subsequent appearance, disbelieved in His signs, fought against Him, disputed His authority, associated with His essence, profaned His words, turned away from His beauty, and was among the polytheists.” This is written in the Tablets of God from the Pen of Holiness.</p>
<p>By God, whenever it was mentioned in Ta, Ya, Iraq, or other places to take action against this group, my brother would travel from Iraq to the surrounding areas, as many have heard and know. This servant was alone among the enemies until the divine power raised the matter, and all were assured of their own souls, coming out from behind the veil. The first thing they did was to cut the Divine Tree. When they saw themselves disappointed and lost in what they intended, they wrote to the surrounding areas, attributing their will to God’s will and purpose.</p>

<section id="victory-for-the-friends-of-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="victory-for-the-friends-of-god">Victory For the Friends of God</h3>
<p>This servant, who had abolished the decree of killing that was widely known among this group, and this has been written in most Tablets by the Pen of God, must have reached some. Among the questions asked was the meaning of the victory mentioned in the divine verses, and what has descended from the Throne in its answer is this, exactly as written:</p>
<p>“The intended victory mentioned in the exalted Tablets is understood to be the friends of God. God, exalted is His mention, is sanctified from the world and what is in it. The intended victory is not that anyone should fight or dispute with anyone else. The dominion of all lands, from land and sea, is in the hands of kings. They are the manifestations of God’s power according to their ranks. If they enter under the shadow of God, they are counted among the people of God, and otherwise, your Lord is knowing and wise. What God has desired for Himself are the hearts of His servants, which are the treasures of divine revelation and the repositories of divine love.</p>
<p>The eternal will of the Everlasting Sovereign has always been to purify the hearts from the hints of the world and what is in it and on it so that they may become receptive to the lights of the manifestations of the Sovereign of Names and Attributes. Therefore, no stranger should enter the city of the heart so that the friend may hasten to his abode, meaning the manifestation of His beauty, not His essence, for He has always been sanctified from ascent and descent. Thus, the victory of God’s Cause today is not by objecting to anyone, disputing with any soul, or fighting with anything. Rather, it is desired that the cities of hearts be conquered by the sword of the tongue and the wisdom of the speech, not by the sword of iron.</p>
<p>Therefore, whoever desires the victory of God should first conquer the city of his own heart with the sword of meanings and words, purify it from everything other than God, and then turn to the cities of hearts. This is the victory of God’s Cause that today has shone forth from the horizon of the Finger of the Sovereign of Names. Corruption has never been desired and never will be. Whatever has happened before was without God’s permission. Today, the friends of God must appear among the people in such a way that all, by their actions, guide them to the Paradise of the Lord of Glory.</p>
<p>By the Sun of the Dawn of Holiness, God and His friends, who are attributed to Him, have never and will never be concerned with the earth and its perishable riches. If the intention was to take possession of the earth, He was certainly capable and powerful, and with a word, He could have taken possession of the entire world. But sovereignty has been granted to kings, wisdom to the discerning, knowledge to the knowers, and the love of the hearts of His servants has been reserved for Himself alone. Without that, He has never been and never will be concerned.</p>
<p>This is also due to the supreme favor that perhaps mortal souls may be purified and sanctified from earthly matters and enter the everlasting station, which is the Paradise of the Majesty of Oneness. Otherwise, the Eternal Sovereign, by Himself for Himself, is independent of all. Neither the love of creatures brings any benefit to Him, nor does their harm cause Him any harm. All will appear from earthly places and return to Him. That Eternal Beauty, alone and single, is stationed at His seat, sanctified from place and time, mention and indication, description and height, and lowliness. Only those with discernment understand this.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they have attributed what they themselves have done to the Most High, though it is clear to all that God does what He wills and is capable of commanding anything. No one can object to Him. By Him in whose hand is my soul, if I had been pleased to harm any soul, the Pen of God would bear witness to it, if you bear witness.</p>

<section id="azalis-claim-bahaullah-had-acquired-knowledge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="azalis-claim-bahaullah-had-acquired-knowledge">Azalis Claim Baha’u’llah Had Acquired Knowledge</h3>
<p>Among other things, they have written in their letters that this servant has studied and that these revealed words are the result of acquired knowledge. Such inappropriate statements have been made at the time of each Manifestation. They said the same about the previous Manifestation and, before that, about Muhammad, the Messenger of God: “A human teaches him.” The tongue to which they refer is foreign, yet this tongue is clear Arabic. Let anyone inquire about my life throughout Iran and Iraq to see the truth and falsehood. Woe to them for what they speak.</p>
<p>O foolish ones, the source of this knowledge is the Ancient Self, and the source of this judgment is the Self of the Greatest God, if you are among those who perceive. If you listen with the ear of innate disposition, you will hear the same objections from the learned and ignorant of the time at the appearance of the Primal Point. By God, O people, I am perplexed by my affair and what has befallen me. I wish I had not been born of my mother, and if born, had not been nursed, and had not grown up. But what appeared has appeared, the hosts of revelation have descended, and the matter has been decreed by God, the One, the Subduer.</p>
<p>O people, listen to my words and then tear away the veils, even if they be the veils of the heavens and the earth. Let nothing prevent you from the breezes of these days. By God, their value is unmatched by the treasures of creation and the treasures of invention. God is a witness and knowledgeable of this. By the sun of the eternal sphere, if this matter were in the hands of this servant, not a single verse would have been recited among these people, for they have entirely deviated from the original divine nature. But God has decreed what He wills and executed what He wishes. No one can turn back His will or alter His decree. He is wise in all things.</p>
<p>If it were not observed that the people of this land are agitated, permission would have been given for all to present themselves before God, to witness what no one in the world has witnessed. Among the writings, it is mentioned that the rank of the Sun is beneath the shadow of the Mirror, and this station is above all ranks. From this Mirror, suns rise. Praise be to God, to what extent have they assumed the ignorance of people, when it is clear and evident that the creation of the Mirror and its existence is for the purpose of reflecting images and likenesses. It is clear to every perceptive person that the manifestation of reflections and images in it does not inherently occur by itself.</p>
<p>This fact is apparent to any knowledgeable person, let alone one with insight. Yet, in their letters, they have written such statements, by God, that no ignorant person would utter. Their intention with these words is to deprive people of the Creator and Realizer of Names and Attributes. This is because they see people immersed in seas of delusion and desire, thinking that what they state will surely be accepted. Otherwise, they would not occupy themselves with such words whose falsehood is clearer than the sun at midday. They have clung to the fact that the Primal Point—may our souls be his sacrifice—called himself in one instance the Mirror of God, and therefore, mirrorhood is above the rank of sunhood.</p>
<p>By Him who caused me to speak the truth and shine forth from the horizon of holiness upon the worlds, if anyone contemplates this single statement, they will comprehend all the claims of this crowd of rabble. First, that Ancient Self has named itself with all Names and described itself with all Attributes, whether of the highest or lowest ranks of Names, as stated in the beginning of the Best of Stories: “Praise be to God who sent down the Book upon His servant to be a shining lamp for the worlds.” Can anyone say that the rank of the lamp is above that of the sun? No, by God, none says this but one who speaks from desire and seeks to cast doubt into clear and luminous hearts. Wretched is what they do.</p>
<p>Certainly, it is known that in that sacred precinct, all Names are on the same level, for that Ancient Being, when saying, “I am the Lord of Lords and I am the earth and the dust,” in that supreme station, both are the same rank and will always be. This most delicate, refined, and pure explanation cannot be grasped by muddled hearts. As that Eternal Beauty states: “Say: I descended until I said, ‘Verily, I am a particle, and less than a particle,’ just as I said, ‘Verily, I am the Lord and the Master of every lord.’ I seek God’s forgiveness for both statements, and I turn to God, my Lord.”</p>

<section id="they-have-not-pondered-the-wisdom-of-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="they-have-not-pondered-the-wisdom-of-god">They Have Not Pondered the Wisdom of God</h3>
<p>Now, O wayfarers in the valley of ignorance and error, who have drunk the cup of boiling water and deemed the path of holiness sealed, you are burning in the fire of desire and consider yourselves among the people of the highest paradise. Alas, how regretful that you have not pondered, even for a moment, upon the wisdom of the All-Merciful and have not, even for an instant, turned your enlightened gaze upon the command of the Lord of Judgment.</p>
<p>You have so veiled the words of the All-Merciful, which have descended with utmost expansion and encompassment, without limits, behind the veil of your own selves, that the tongues of the world are powerless to describe it. Now, consider this statement that has flowed from the Pen of the divine Holiness: “I have descended to the station where I declare, ‘I am a particle and less than a particle,’ just as I have declared, ‘I am the Lord and the Lord of all lords.’ Indeed, I seek forgiveness for both of these utterances.”</p>
<p>Consider how that Eternal Beauty has named Himself with all Names. Can it then be said that a particle is above the sun, or dust above the Lord of Lords? Be just, if you are among the just. By Him who made me the manifestation of His essence and then His being, His might, and His glory, if you reflect upon these blessed divine words, the gates of limitless knowledge will open upon the hearts, such that you will no longer be disturbed by whether someone is named with the Names of God, the Essence of God, or the Mirror of God. For all Names in that sacred precinct are equal, and there is no distinction among them. All these Names revolve around the manifestation of the Ancient Self, as if, at this moment, the Eternal Beauty were to name a tree with all the Most Beautiful Names and Loftiest Attributes, He is indeed capable of doing so, and no one can object to Him because He is the chosen one, and all else is within His grasp. There is no god but Him, the Mighty, the Compeller.</p>
<p>Moreover, all creation is named as delicate mirrors. It is stated that if these mirrors are touched by the attractions of divine love, they will attract, and if touched by anything other than love, dust will descend upon those mirrors, creating a barrier between the mirror and the recognition of the command of the All-Powerful, All-Knowing Lord. He says, “Indeed, creation is delicate mirrors; if touched by love, they attract, and if touched by anything other than love, dust descends upon them, creating a barrier between them and the command of their Lord.”</p>

<p>Reflect, O heedless ones. This statement was made by the Primal Point, exalted be His greatness. If specifically addressed to Mr.&nbsp;Sayyid Jawad, He says, “You are the primal mirror that has always reflected the Truth and will always reflect it.” He has also called him the primal cause. By God, this rank is above all Names, whether it be the Essence of God, the Being of God, the Mention of God, or the Mirror of God. In the past, whoever attributed this rank to the Messenger of God was judged as an infidel because they regarded the primal cause as the Truth.</p>
<p>It is also revealed in regard to him, “We have made you a prophet over the worlds.” With all these ranks and descriptions, which have not been surpassed in the Bayan, if, God forbid, he turns away from the Truth, all those close to him will be removed. If you observe with enlightened vision, all things in the Bayan are named with all the Most Beautiful Names, but only the pure-hearted understand. These words are mentioned so that it is known that the attributes revealed in the Bayan are not exclusive to one person over another; rather, they are established for all as long as they remain under the shadow of God. After departing from this, all are deprived and forbidden.</p>

<p>Likewise, regarding the rank of His Holiness Quddus, may the spirit of the worlds be his sacrifice, it is stated that eight units of the Mirror of God are in his noble self, and from the intensity of the fire of the love of God, no one has the power to draw near to him. Now, consider that eight units of the Mirror of God are mentioned in his noble self. Reflect, O people of thought. In this statement, treasures of knowledge are hidden. This servant did not mention it for fear of the Nimrod of oppression and the Pharaoh of ignorance.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationship-of-suns-and-mirrors">Relationship of Suns and Mirrors</h3>
<p>Similarly, in all stations, it is revealed by the Pen of Might that the Mirror does not inherently manifest itself except by its encounter with the sun, and the sun has always been and will always be one. No one has been named with this name except the Eternal Self in every Manifestation. Yet, it is written that the rank of the sun is beneath the rank of the mirror, and suns rise from the mirror. By God, O people, I do not speak from desire. If you reflect on this statement, you will surely witness that these words arise from sheer ignorance and pure hatred.</p>
<p>I adjure you, O people, by God who created and shaped you, to observe the first part of the Persian Bayan, where it is stated, “If the mirror says, ‘The sun is in me,’ it is evident to the sun that it is its image that speaks.”</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subh-i-azals-claims-to-be-above-the-sun">Subh-i-Azal’s Claims To Be Above the Sun</h2>
<p>Yet, it is written (by Subh-i-Azal) that the mirror is above the sun, and the suns are in the shadow of the mirror. If by these suns he means the suns of reality, this is far from the truth, for with a single manifestation of the true sun, a hundred thousand mirrors come into existence in less than an instant. The mirrors are created to reflect a manifestation of the sun if they are pure, otherwise, they are judged as stones. It is evident to everyone with vision that mirrors are created to capture the reflections of objects. And if by suns, he means the suns of names and beyond, this is not specific to any self, as all these suns exist and appear at the time decreed by God.</p>
<p>Whoever opens the eyes of his heart will see in every atom a sun, and then in this sun, another sun, and in the sun of the sun, another sun, without end. But God’s wisdom did not mention this station, lest the feet of the knowers slip. O people, woe unto you from the injustice that has befallen the Ancient Beauty from those who boast of standing before Him, but when His name became famous, they disbelieved in the Sovereign, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p>Since the previous manifestation, the world was aware that the mirror in the next manifestation would claim to be the sun, so this decree issued from the pen of the Exalted. He is so immersed in the sea of pride and arrogance that he has clung to the words of the previous manifestation to elevate his own status and has turned away from the source, the origin, and the manifestation, the creator, and the sender of those words. Woe unto the unjust people. He also called himself the great tree, but by God, all these words are because he finds people foolish. If he were considered a tree before God, he would be a tree that should fall and be cast into the fire unless he repents to God and seeks forgiveness for his actions and becomes one of the repentant.</p>
<p>It is clear to everyone, whether migrants of this land or those with keen insight, who observe things with God’s vision, that these arrogant words have not flowed from a false, fabricated tongue except that when they saw this new, most exalted sun rising from the horizon of eternal dawn and proclaiming in the heavens and the earth, “I am the Living One in the Most Glorious Horizon,” they hastened and spoke these words without realizing it, trying to establish a station for themselves higher than that of God. But this is impossible, for everything beneath it is created and moved by His will, and those above it are only His servants, creatures, and worshippers.</p>
<p>How can there be a station above that of God for someone to claim for himself, as if he stood by himself for himself in the highest position that has no above or below, no right or left, no front or back, and who created directions without direction by His will and things without example by His will, and who is the creator of every station and the revealer of every matter?</p>
<p>It is His right that no one below Him should boast for himself, for He does not boast of any of the beings, and He is the sanctified, pure, all-powerful, and obeyed.</p>
<p>O people, listen to my call and do not bring upon my beauty what you have been forbidden in all tablets. By God, this is the outstretched hand of divine power that encompasses all who are in the heavens and the earth. This is the tongue of the divine truth singing on the highest lote-tree of the exalted oneness. This is the pen of the Ancient, from which the seas of divine mysteries and knowledge have flowed and will continue to flow in the days and nights.</p>
<p>This is the repository of the pearls of decisive wisdom and the source of divine sciences, which has always and will always bestow its favors. Beware that you do not deprive yourselves of its showers of grace and do not consider it obligatory to follow any blind soul.</p>
<p>In his treatise, he has also stated that by knowing a few important phrases and words, he made these claims, and his intention with these ornate words was this holy, sublime essence. By the One who is exalted in power and might, he has striven hard in teaching it, just as teachers teach children their alphabets.</p>
<p>Would that my people knew how insignificant and contemptible his station is and how great his arrogance and pride are. This is clear and evident to every discerning person and does not need further mention or detail. Among his statements is that this servant has spoken disrespectfully towards the First Point, whereas this servant proclaims between the heavens and the earth that he is nothing but his own self, essence, spirit, body, and glory.</p>
<p>How could I speak of that exalted essence and the pure, most glorious one, the spirit of all who dwell in the realms of everlasting life, without the pleasure of God? It is similar to what the people of the Qur’an attributed at the beginning of the dawn of the manifestation, that this group does not love, perhaps to keep the servants away from recognizing the self of God on the Day of Resurrection, as they have done and continue to do. Cursed be those who acknowledge this.</p>
<p>Although the wonderful traces have encompassed the entire world, all the people of the Bayan bear witness to this, and what has been revealed in the Bayan from this wondrous manifestation is the same. None of the people of the Bayan lack the trace of God, and beyond that, all that is present in this land. The book has been incapable of recording it, and many remain illiterate. Yet, despite writing, he has made these claims with a mere understanding of phrases and a few words. Now, judge fairly a word whose falsehood is as bright and clear as the sun at midday.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, with what courage and audacity did he speak? By God, the One besides whom there is no other, this servant never intended to make what descended from the heaven of the divine will known to the lands, for very few pure sights are seen that are worthy of observing the traces of God. Therefore, I always kept them concealed. Many of the divine verses revealed in Iraq were cast into the river and erased.</p>
<section id="permission-was-not-granted-to-compile-bahaullahs-writings-into-a-volume" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="permission-was-not-granted-to-compile-bahaullahs-writings-into-a-volume">Permission Was Not Granted To Compile Baha’u’llah’s Writings into a Volume</h3>
<p>Now, about one hundred thousand verses are present in this land and are yet to be written down, let alone bound into volumes. These matters pertain to self-display, which this servant has always been sanctified from and will remain so. Several times, some have sought to compile what exists into volumes and send them to the regions, but permission has not yet been granted. Just as the First Point, may the souls of all be his sacrifice, himself did not pay attention to these matters, stating that they should be organized in the best order later. He, exalted be His mention, says: “Blessed is he who looks at the order of Bahá’u’lláh and thanks his Lord, for it will manifest, and none can turn it back, from God, in the Bayan.”</p>
<p>And similarly, after the ascension of the Messenger of God, the Qur’an was compiled into a book, and before it, the Gospel. Despite the verses of the Exalted Sacred One having encompassed the east and the west of the world, they have clung to these words and interpreted them with four words, just as the rituals of Hajj were issued from the exalted pen in previous years. Nevertheless, only one Surah, known as the Surah of Hajj, was sent. This servant has never spent time in making such matters known and never will. The revelation of the station is God’s matter, and its dissemination is for the people, and He indeed is the promulgator of His cause by the hands of the spreaders from the angels of the near ones.</p>
<p>Behind the canopy of divine sanctity, spiritual servants must appear, collect the traces of God, and organize them with the best order. This is inevitable without doubt. Furthermore, they have written some phrases and attributed them to the Primal Point, may all souls be a sacrifice for Him. This is a blatant lie, and at that moment, the Primal Point disowns them and their words, and God bears witness to this if you do not bear witness. How much they boast of names, and by God, the One besides whom there is no other, such souls have never been seen in innovation.</p>
<p>They have spent day and night trying to find a word in the Book of God to interpret for themselves. When I was separated from my brother, I sent a box of scripts and circles and forms, written by the hand of the Primal Point, to my brother. I sent a message saying, “Since you are very keen to take pride in these traces after turning away from the truth, I am sending them to you so that you may send these forms to some people of various lands and show off your status, or distribute them to every soul that comes to you.” Today, you are engaged in that very act, and perhaps you have added some fabricated words to these words in order to mislead the feet of the knowers.</p>
<p>O servants, turn away from these matters and sanctify your hearts, for today a grace has appeared that if a scribe can keep up, an equivalent to the Persian Bayan descends from the heaven of divine sanctity in one day and night. Similarly, in the matter of the verses in a new Arabic tongue, be present before the Throne to witness with your own eyes. Do not compare the words of God with the words of others and be enlightened with insight, O people. Bear witness to what God has testified and do not turn to anyone else, and do not be among the doubters. God has testified that there is no god but He, and that the Primal Point is His servant and His glory. Thus, it was revealed before from the Pen of God, the Exalted, the Great. If you had fully comprehended the meaning of this verse, you would never have been veiled from the greatest divine path. Today, most of the people of the Bayan bear witness, and when they reach this blessed name, their faces darken, their hearts tremble, and their feet slip, and they are among those who hesitate.</p>

<p>By the truth of God, no act is accepted before God unless it includes acknowledgment of this pure blessed name. Blessed are those who remember and those who are firm. Moreover, in his treatises, he boasted that Jinab-i-Táhirih and Jinab-i-Azim had submitted to him. Although this servant considers of such matters to be utterly void and non-existent, this is not out of arrogance or pride, for this servant has seen and will see no station for himself.</p>

<section id="proofs-of-bahaullahs-station" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proofs-of-bahaullahs-station">Proofs of Baha’u’llah’s Station</h2>
<p>But, with regard to the manifestation of God’s station, it has been mentioned because the essences of letters, their origins, and their mysteries have always been and will continue to be sent forth. The truth does not need to prove its manifestation by anything other than itself and what appears from it, for every proof is firmly established by its relation to it, and every path is straight by its connection to it. However, since people are observed to be weak and not mature, this servant states that what has been revealed from the words of God specifically for this cause is beyond the comprehension of these souls. If people look with the eye of God, the statement of the Primal Point, “Indeed, I am the Living One in the Most Glorious Horizon,” which is clear, apparent, and shining today, would suffice them all.</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone hears and sees everything that is said and committed by all creatures. Furthermore, the testimony mentioned in the tablets, commanding everyone to read it, is a clear proof for anyone who observes with the eye of God. His statement, “God has testified that there is no god but He and that the Primal Point is His servant and His glory,” is a clear and conclusive proof. However, it only increases the misguided in loss, for the misguided interpret all the verses with delusion.</p>
<p>He also says, exalted be His mention, “Indeed, I am the Throne of Glory with the greater truth; I was above the rise of the flowing ruby atop the mount.” The intended meaning of this blessed verse, if contemplated, reveals the highest, most exalted, and most sanctified manifestation. He also says, exalted be His station, “God has created around that gate seas of the elixir water reddened with the oil of existence and life with the intended abundance, and God has decreed for it ships of fresh, red rubies, and none shall ride them except the people of glory by the permission of the Most High, for He is the Almighty, the Wise.”</p>
<p>Now, the ships of fresh, red rubies sail and flow on the sea of greatness. O people of glory, detach from all else and enter the eternal ark of divine dignity. Whoever holds fast to this ark is, in the sight of God, among those who affirm, are saved, and are in the high and pleasing stations. Whoever falls behind is among the people of fire, ruin, and lowly and infernal states. Beware, do not sell your religion for a coin, and do not trade the Joseph of divine glory for the bounties of this world and the hereafter. Soon, you will see what is now visible become absent. Therefore, strive with utmost effort and haste to the shade of the Lord of creation, for there is no safe refuge except His shade, and there never will be.</p>
<p>His statement, exalted in His majesty, “As for the youth, he is from the fire of the green tree kindled from this yellow essence; we killed him in the visible form because God had decreed a portion for his parents in the Book, and we feared that he would oppress them with the fire in the beauty of glory, tyranny without knowledge,” is very clear that everyone has oppressed this most pure, most luminous, most glorious beauty in a way that none but God knows. If only they had sufficed with oppression and arrogance, but they have always been engaged in the destruction of the house of God and His sanctuary and will continue to be so. However, their hearts will not rest until they drink my blood after we created and preserved them to elevate my cause and assist my beauty. When they found their strength and felt secure, they rose against me with great tyranny. When it reached that point, a caller called from behind the veil of eternity, “O exalted pen, do not limit your cause to mentioning less than it, say: By God, the Bayan was all revealed for my wondrous, supreme cause, and without you, not a letter of the Bayan would have been revealed, nor any pages of the exalted, honored one. Leave the dead, for those who do not believe in you are dead, not alive; they do not hear nor understand, even if words from the first and the last were cast upon them. But those whom God has revived through you, they have read all the books in your love and need nothing else but you, for your manifestation itself has made you a proof for all worlds.” When I heard the call, I sufficed with what was inscribed by the radiant, sanctified finger.</p>
<p>The verses of divine majesty in this name and appearance are more than can be counted. Nevertheless, these rabble have interpreted this blessed name as the land of Ta, whereas the Primal Point, may all souls be a sacrifice for Him, called it the land of glory. They did not understand that His intention was to foretell the appearance of the sacred beauty in that land, saying, “O land, upon you walks the glory, and in you resides this radiant, shining name.” In every instance, this blessed name has been mentioned before all names, and similarly, in the previous prayer, the most ancient of names is mentioned with this blessed name, saying, “O my God, I ask you by your most glorious name.” Similarly, the months, named with new names, the first of them is attributed to this name. In everything, if you observe, the best of it is mentioned with this name. Yet, see to what extent the animosity has reached that they interpreted this blessed name as a land, whereas a particle of its dust is better than them and their selves and their realities. Woe to them and to what their hearts contain of the fire of envy and hatred, with which they burn themselves every moment, and they are unaware.</p>
<p>And also His Holiness Quddús, may His glory be exalted, inscribed several Tablets in the land of Badasht and sent them. This servant has never disclosed them. Among them, He has clearly, without any allusion, mentioned the following about this new Cause: “When the Lord manifests a mystery from the horizon of splendor in a land or a place, that luminous countenance from the point of splendor becomes adorned. And when the heavens of attraction arise with the lines of the secret written, that is from Our command for the people of knowledge, it is evident.”</p>
<p>These blessed Tablets are now present, and all of them explicitly bear witness and testimony to this Cause. By the Lord of the Throne and the firmament, modesty prevents the mention of these words, as this servant has never desired to assert any station for himself through previous words, for my station is His station, and it is evident in the midst of the sky of independence. And there is no one with sight but witnesses and sees, and for the blind, there is no portion.</p>
<p>Say: By God, my station is His station, my power is His power, my sovereignty is His sovereignty, His manifestation is my proof, and what flows from His Pen is my testimony, just as my manifestation is my proof, and what flows from my Pen is my testimony. However, out of consideration for the preservation of Our servants, it is written explicitly. And among them is the point of attraction, His Holiness Tá, upon whom be the Most Glorious Beauty of God, who has been with this servant for a long time and would never exchange the meeting of this servant with the dominion of this world and the hereafter, and did not wish to part from me even for a moment. But what was destined, happened. And how many verses and poems He mentioned in this new Cause, among them in describing the Most High Countenance, He composed a ghazal, one verse of which is:</p>
<p>“If Splendor removes the veil from the face,</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands like Azal will appear.”</p>
<section id="the-primal-point-established-his-cause-with-the-same-proof" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-primal-point-established-his-cause-with-the-same-proof">The Primal Point Established His Cause With the Same Proof</h3>
<p>And He has also praised this servant abundantly. Above all these statements is the Hidden Book of the Primal Point, may our souls be sacrificed for Him, which has been revealed entirely in this new Cause and has remained concealed from sight. Ask God to attain it. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if the claimant of divine beauty today had not mentioned such proofs in his book and had not relied on them to mislead the people, this servant would never have used these proofs as an argument.</p>
<p>O servants, listen to the call of the Exalted One in His latter manifestation, and erase all these proofs from your hearts, for if you rely on words, hints, scriptures, and books in this wondrous, divine manifestation, you will never attain the essence of the knowledge of the Face of the Merciful and the Sovereign of existence. Rather, look to the same proof by which the Primal Point Himself, exalted be His glory, established His Cause, and likewise, before Him, Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and before Him, the Son of Mary, and before Him, Moses. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, one letter of the verses of God is more precious to this servant than all that is in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that during the time of manifestation, do not look to words, hints, proofs, names, and attributes. This is a command that the Primal Point Himself, may our souls be sacrificed for Him, has given. The intention of that divine beauty is that, during the time of manifestation, the people of the Bayán should not cling to traditions and verses like the people of the Qur’án and object to the Manifestation, the Originator, and the Revealer of those.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you reflect a little on this most wondrous, most mighty manifestation, you will be informed of countless secrets and will observe that from the beginning of creation until now, no such manifestation has appeared, though, considering the lack of capacity among the servants, there are also reasons for prevention. To separate the essence from the accident and the spirit from the clay. By God, the Truth, today, if a particle of the essence were mixed with a hundred thousand measures of stone and hidden behind the seven seas, the hand of God’s power would surely reveal it and separate that particle of essence from it.</p>
<p>O people, the breeze of God is blowing, the spirit of God is in motion, and the attraction of God has dawned from the horizon of the rising of the beauty of the Merciful. Raise your heads from the slumber of the self and passion and observe what has appeared in the creation. Beware, do not listen to the falsehoods of the people, for today, if a pure ear is found, it will hear from this group what it heard from the people of the Qur’án, and what it heard from the people of the Torah and the Gospel, and more than their sayings, it will witness the same deeds with the eye of the inner and outer vision.</p>
<p>Today, someone who has opposed the Self of God and has shown arrogance towards His creation has mentioned in his words that if the Truth appears, whether from the people of the Bayán or others, whether slave or free, whether black or white, this servant will be obedient and will have no word to say. Now observe this statement, made at a time when he is engaged in fighting against the beauty of God and in utmost aversion.</p>

<section id="scholars-who-issue-fatwas-to-kill" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scholars-who-issue-fatwas-to-kill">Scholars Who Issue Fatwas to Kill</h3>
<p>Now reflect and observe what the proof of God has been and what the sign of the appearance of the Truth is. This manifestation, so apparent, whose lights have enveloped the world, he has turned away from and stood up to kill, and afterward engaged in these words out of the delusion of the people. Just like at the beginning of the manifestation, when the scholars of the Qur’án, with prayer beads in hand, in utmost humility and devotion, would engage in worship in their sanctuaries, showing such piety that when the name of God was mentioned, they would stand up with utmost humility and submission.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time, they issued fatwas for His killing and executed judgments lower than faith upon Him, while speaking with their tongues, saying, “How could we be turning away from the Truth, while we pray at night and ask from God during the day? Whenever He appears, we will be obedient and submissive.” Now, they are turning away from God. By God, besides whom there is no god, they cut off the head of the Manifestation of the Self of God with the knife of malice and corruption and the sword of hatred and enmity, and at the same time, with a submissive neck, they utter this word, “Whenever the Truth appears, I will be obedient.”</p>
<p>By God, O people, they have found you immature to speak such nonsense, and they have found you so deluded that the Truth, which has appeared in all manifestations, they have given a fatwa for His killing and have been constantly fighting against His beauty, and yet they speak these words. Alas and regret upon you, for you have been heedless of Him who has appeared more manifest than any manifestation and have occupied yourselves with those who, by God, if you were aware of Him, you would flee from them a thousand distances.</p>
<p>We ask God to separate me from him and to purify the land I am on from the filth of these transgressors, or to settle me in another land, for He is indeed gracious to His servants, and He is indeed powerful over all things.</p>

<p>Say: O ignorant one, the Beloved Self is manifest and radiant like the sun, and today you have not attained knowledge of Him. Instead, you do not count Him among the people of faith, despite all His proofs and evidences that have encompassed the world. Nevertheless, you cling to His words, intending to establish a leadership for yourself. By the True God, all things deny you, but you do not perceive it. Your status before God is like that of the people of the Qur’án who established their leadership by the words of the Messenger, sitting on the thrones of glory and judgment, and inflicted upon Him what no eye in creation had seen or comprehended.</p>
<p>O one intoxicated with the wine of self and desire, you have overlooked the known Sovereign and clung to your delusion. This humiliation suffices for you, that you have denied the verses by which your religion was established and in which you take pride, seeking to establish a status for yourself, yet you are unaware. You have no status before God except like those who turned away after believing and denied after acknowledging. If you were truly knowledgeable, by the True God, the faithful spirit would turn its head away from your actions, and you have not realized it, being among the heedless. The houris of the chambers sit on ashes due to your oppression, while you are joyful within yourself. By the True God, everything laments and weeps within itself, but you are oblivious and among the heedless.</p>
<p>You mention the Beloved with your tongue to testify against the people, yet you kill the Beloved of the First and the Last. If God were to open your sight, you would witness that by your injustice, the Beloved is suspended in the air, and you constantly hurl at Him the arrows of envy and hatred, followed by the darts of malice and stubbornness, then by the bullets of aversion. God has indeed been a witness and knowledgeable about this. Muhammad laments in the highest horizon, the spirit weeps in the sublime companion, Moses mourns at the Lote Tree of the furthest boundary, and the eyes of the prophets and messengers cry.</p>
<p>O one intoxicated with the wine of pride, awaken for a moment with awareness. Reflect on yourself and your actions. Suppose you have confused the immature ones about the Cause of God, making all of them bow to you instead of God. What benefit do you gain from this? No, by the Lord of the worlds, you gain nothing but the loss of this world and the hereafter. If today you sit on a throne of ruby, before God, you dwell in the abyss. By God, if you listen with the ear of nature, you will hear that the very earth on which you sit seeks refuge in God from you and says: O heedless one, by what proof and evidence do you establish your truth and deny the Truth of Him who is the Truth and the One who establishes the Truth?</p>
<p>Woe unto you and those who have taken you as a beloved for themselves instead of God. You did not become certain in the truth, so why did you rise up to kill Him? For twenty years He strove to protect you, knowing what was in your heart, and if He had willed for a moment, you would not have existed. Yet you did not awaken, and you attributed your actions to the Truth throughout the world. By God, there is nothing in this heart except the lights of the effulgences of the dawn of eternity, and it is not content with anything harmful to itself.</p>
<p>O my brother, hear the call of the one who, due to your injustice, has fallen into this pit which has no bottom, and whose garment is stained with sincere blood because of your malice. From the bottom of the pit, he cries out, saying: “O my brother, do not do to your brother what the son of Adam did to his brother. O my brother, fear God, and do not dispute my verses, do not fight against my Self, and do not kill the one whose chest has become a place for the swords of the enemies, lest harm befall you. He who has safeguarded you every night and day, every morning and evening, O my brother, by the True God, I do not speak from desire. This is nothing but a revelation revealed. The Mighty Spirit taught me at the Lote Tree of the farthest boundary. By God, O my brother, these are not from myself but from the Mighty, the Wise. Every time I approached you to prevent any disturbance that might test the servants, safeguarding the command of your Lord, by God, you cast towards me the arrow of dissension. And whenever I drew closer to you, hoping to calm your soul, you rose against me with hypocrisy. Your very being testifies to this if you are among those who deny.</p>
<p>By God, O my brother, whenever I remained silent about the wondrous mentions of my Lord, the Holy Spirit raised me to His command, and the Great Spirit awakened me from my sleep and made me speak the truth between the heavens and the earth. If this is my sin, I am not the first to sin. Those before me committed it: the one named ’Ali in the Kingdom of Names, then Muhammad in the realm of the most exalted, then my Son in the supreme assembly, then the Interlocutor in this sacred, blessed, mighty, and lofty Sinai.</p>
<p>O my brother, look into the books of the prophets and messengers, and then see the proofs of God, His evidence, His signs, His manifestations, and His verses in their hands. Be just with your brother and do not be among those who wronged the Self of God and then oppressed themselves to instill doubt and suspicion in the hearts of the believers. By God, when your brother knew you rose against him and the fire of envy would not be quenched in your chest, he left with his family alone and entered another house, closing the door to entry and exit. He remained there as one of the wayfarers. Yet you, O my brother, were not content within yourself and wrote and sent what you sent. By God, the Pen is ashamed to write what you mentioned and what you falsely attributed to your brother. By this, you have ruined my sanctity and the sanctity of God among the servants.</p>
<p>You will witness and see, and at that time you will be among the heedless. Arise from the slumber of your soul and desire. Trim the mustache of envy and clip the nails of hatred. Purify yourself with the fragrance of loyalty. Wash with the waters of holiness. Place your face on the ground in humility, submission, repentance, and return to the Beloved.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-prayer-for-subh-i-azal-to-pray">A Prayer For Subh-i-Azal to Pray</h3>
<p>Say: O Lord, I am the one who neglected the rights of my brother during these nights and days and was heedless of the wondrous mentions of Your wisdom. So, O my God, lift the veil from my sight so that I may know Your Self, praise You, and detach from all else but You, turning towards Your noble face. Make me among Your servants, who have a place of truth near You, and grant me from the nectar of Your grace and the abundant bounty of Your kindness. Join me with Your sincere servants who did not turn to the world, its leadership, or anything within or upon it, but devoted themselves and their wealth in the path of their Creator, and were among the detached.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not leave me to myself. Take my hand with the hand of Your power. Rescue me from the depths of the soul and desire, and its flames. Make that fire for me coolness, peace, rest, and fragrance. Write me among Your detached servants. O Lord, grant me success in serving You and proclaiming Your verses. Make me a helper for Your cause, a protector of Your religion, a speaker of Your praise, and an expounder of Your bounties and grace. You are the Mighty, the Generous.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not disappoint those who cling to the cord of Your favor, and do not drive away those who hold onto the finger of hope in Your great generosity and bounty.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not veil me from the source of Your good pleasure, and grant me contentment with what You have decreed and revealed from the clouds of Your grace and the showers of Your bounteous honor. You are the Giver in all conditions, and You are indeed the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not strip my body of the garment of justice, and do not deprive my heart of the robe of acknowledgment by Your Self, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p>O Lord, make my feet firm on Your path so that I do not deny what You have called me to in all Your verses, Tablets, Scriptures, Books, and Holy Scrolls. O Lord, let me turn towards Your bounties and return to the ocean of Your forgiveness, so do not deprive me of Your beautiful praise. You are the one who can do whatever You will, and You are the Mighty, the Powerful.</p>
<p>O Lord, enable me not to deny what has affirmed my faith, established my remembrance, raised my name, stirred my being, and verified my reality, and make me among the believers.</p>
<p>O Lord, do not deprive those who stand before the city of Your mercy and cling to the hem of Your kindness and bounty.</p>
<p>O Lord, write for me a word from Yourself, that I may remember it at dusk and dawn and at all times, as You have spoken through the tongue of the oppressed in the depths of the pit. Perhaps I may take the path to the horizon of justice when God addresses the breeze of His holiness, which blows from the direction of the Throne and makes it a messenger to the world. For in those days, He found no messenger to send to the servants with the glad tidings of His command and to make them among the remembering and rejoicing ones. He was cast into a prison cut off from the hands of the seekers and the feet of the wayfarers, and beyond the prison, He fell into the pit of envy, whose bottom was known only to His all-knowing, all-aware Self.</p>

<p>But, O breeze, pass with complete detachment, so that if the harm of the worlds befalls you, you remain patient, and if their bounties descend upon you, you do not pay attention to them.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-purpose-of-god-and-his-messengers">The Purpose of God and His Messengers</h3>
<p>Thus commands you the tongue of your Lord, so that you may be among the doers. Say: O lovers and O possessors of understanding, finally, detach your gaze from the world and its affairs, and with the eye of insight, observe the apparent affairs and radiant conditions that have appeared and become manifest from the direction of the Most Glorious Throne. Reflect so that in these days, when the intoxication of heedlessness has enveloped all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, you may draw yourself to the divine city of unity and not be deprived of His endless mercy. Lest, God forbid, you become veiled from the primary, divine purpose and be counted among the heedless in the Book of the Lord of lords, without realizing it. We seek refuge in God from that, O possessors of understanding.</p>
<p>All the prophets and messengers have called people to the path of the knowledge of the beauty of the Merciful, for this station has been and will always be the highest of stations. Reflect a little on the sending of the divine messengers and the reason and cause for which these embodiments of oneness have come from the unseen into the realm of the seen and have borne all these trials and tribulations that you have heard of. There is no doubt that the purpose was nothing other than inviting the servants to the knowledge of the beauty of the Merciful, and it will never be otherwise.</p>
<p>If you say that the purpose was the commandments and prohibitions, there is no doubt that this was not the primary purpose and never will be. Just as if the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth perform worship and are deprived of the knowledge of God, it will never benefit those who act upon it. This is clear and evident in all the heavenly books. If a soul is knowledgeable of the truth and abandons all the divine commandments, there is hope for salvation, as it is clear and proven to the possessors of insight. Therefore, the primary purpose of creation, the appearance of invention, the sending of messengers, the revealing of books, and the bearing of countless hardships by the messengers was all due to the knowledge of the beauty of the Sublime.</p>
<p>Now, if a soul engages in all acts and spends their entire life in standing, sitting, mentioning, thinking, and other acts, but is deprived of the knowledge of God, no benefit will ever return to him. The knowledge of God has always been the knowledge of the manifestation of His Self among His creation, as is mentioned and proven in all special books, in the statements of all Tablets, this exalted matter, and this supreme and noble truth. Blessed are the knowledgeable ones.</p>
<p>And if you observe with the purest sight, it becomes evident that all the manifestations of divine unity, who have sacrificed their lives, wealth, honor, and name for the sake of the Beloved, had no other purpose but to lead humanity to the path of knowledge. Now consider the Prophets who endured countless afflictions in the hope that people might tear through the veils of illusion and drink from the fountain of certainty. The veils of illusion appeared immense and overwhelming in the eyes of the people. Thus, every Messenger who manifested from the divine realm faced universal opposition from the masses, until the sending of the Messengers culminated in the Guide of Paths in the year sixty. It was seen how far people, due to the illusions of their souls, had strayed from the shore of divine sanctity, such that in their minds, nothing of God remained but desire, and nothing of certainty but apparent doubt.</p>
<p>When the Most Great Beauty commanded the tearing of the veils, everyone rose in opposition. However, a few who became aware of the true purpose burnt away all the veils of illusion and the clouds of doubts with the fire of the divine Lote Tree and attained the knowledge of the Beauty of the Merciful. By God, the True, if anyone contemplates the adversities faced by that Blessed Beauty from the learned and the countless afflictions, they would spend their entire life in wailing, lamentation, and sorrow. Ultimately, the enemies of that Manifest Beauty suspended Him in the air and cut down the Lote Tree of invincible might with the bullets of polytheism and hatred.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bab-speaks-to-the-people-of-the-bayan">The Bab Speaks to the People of the Bayan</h2>
<p>Even when that Blessed Beauty was hanging in the air, He spoke with a clear and eloquent tongue these firm and solid words: “O people of the Bayan, reflect on this creation. All consider themselves knowledgeable of the Truth and travelers on the path of certainty. They are constantly engaged in the remembrance and words of the Merciful and never abandon the commandments of the King, the All-Knowing, even for a day. If any soul does, they immediately regret it. Despite this, they hang and martyr the essence of the Merciful and the purest substance of the Sublime, which they had adhered to for knowledge, never recognizing Him. They have deprived themselves of all divine favors and celestial grace. They are in the depths of fire and consider themselves among the people of Paradise, immersed in the sea of torment, and reckon themselves among the loved ones of the Lord of Lords. They deem themselves to be in the utmost proximity to the Truth but are in extreme remoteness.</p>
<p>So, O people of the Bayan, in every moment, trust in the Beauty of the Lord of all worlds and seek refuge in Him, lest you bring upon my Beauty in this final Manifestation what this group has brought upon Me in this time. O people of the Bayan, the community of the Furqan had no proof in their hands except the Furqan, which was the criterion between truth and falsehood in those days. When my Beauty of the All-Glorious and Most Merciful dawned from the horizon of divine sanctity, I manifested myself with that proof and even greater, so that they might recognize the proof from the previous one and not deprive themselves of acknowledging the Beauty of Certainty. Yet, they recite the verses of the Furqan in all days but are prevented and deprived of these new verses, whose proof is as evident as the sun in the sky.</p>
<p>At the time of the appearance of these divine verses, some claimed that these verses were stolen from previous books, while some foolish tongues spoke that these verses emerged from the self and desire. Thus, we testified against them, and you are among the witnesses. The matter reached such a point that while invoking my name, they wounded my body, and while priding themselves in knowing me, they shot at my known Beauty. This is the condition of the world and its people, until my delicate spirit was freed from the impurities of the polytheistic souls and soared to the most exalted, most elevated, most glorious station and the most sacred, most guarded, and most splendid companion. After my blessed spirit ascended to the highest horizon, I observed with grace and favor towards those who claimed to love me, to see who would act according to my counsels and obey my commands.</p>
<p>When the Tongue of Eternity speaks from the horizon of the All-Glorious and says, “O assembly of the Bayan, this is my Beauty that has appeared with my verses and then with my Manifestations. Why did you disbelieve in it and turn away from it? Indeed, I have become certain that you did not believe in me, as it was proven at the time of my appearance that the assembly of the Furqan did not believe in Muhammad, the Manifestation of Myself, as it became evident during the appearance of Muhammad that the assembly of the Gospel did not believe in My Son, as it became evident during the coming of the Spirit that the people of the Torah did not believe in the Speaker. So return and then look until the matter reaches the first Manifestation.”</p>
<p>Thus, we bestow upon you from the secrets of what has been, so that perhaps you may become among the discerning in yourselves. Not many days passed after my martyrdom when a new grace dawned from the sacred horizon of the Most Glorious and an exalted favor shone from the zenith of the highest glory. The ancient pure one manifested with the Most Great and Most Honored Beauty from the unseen Ridvan, with the same proof that I had made proof and with the same argument that was acceptable before God, rather with all the attributes of divine unity, the manifestations of divine might, the innermost essences of the unseen, which cannot be perceived, and the indications of invincible might. Yet, O assembly of the Bayan, from all directions, you have gathered with the swords of illusions and the signs of the greatest Throne, and in every moment, you have inflicted upon this exalted, invincible Beauty the arrows of hatred. By my Beauty, if you consider the present and turn to the truth, you will see that seas of blood flow from my body, and the effects of the swords of hatred are evident on my limbs. You have not thought about why I sacrificed my life and endured all these swords of infamy and bullets of hatred. It is clear that my only purpose was the recognition of the Manifestation of Myself. And when the Manifestation of Myself appeared with full splendor, you acted in this manner, which has become evident. Now, if you are questioned in the great assembly about what you have done, what will you say to the Lord of Lords? No, by God, you will never have the strength to speak, for it has been a short time since my occultation, and you have witnessed all the proofs of the Manifestation and the events that occurred. Despite this, you have been heedless of the Beauty whose words confirmed all previous and subsequent attributes and remained veiled by the illusions of self and desire from the supreme vision.</p>
<p>O people, in all the tablets of the Bayan, I have given everyone glad tidings of this holy, invincible Manifestation and have said that in the time of the rising of this most great Luminary, do not be occupied with anything created between the heavens and the earth and remain veiled from the Ancient Beauty. I also explicitly said, O people, beware if at the time of appearance you become veiled by the One of the Bayan. It is known that the One of the Bayan is the first creation of the Bayan before God and is given precedence over all. I also explicitly said, O people, beware if at the time of appearance you become veiled by what has been revealed in the Bayan. Now, O people, you are in a state described in the Bayan, and you do not know what the purpose is and for whom it is intended, for no soul was aware of my purpose. Despite this, you have turned away from the source of the description and its revealer, and from the one who manifested and realized it, from whom these manifestations were created and will continue to be created. You have issued a verdict for His death. By God, you have always harmed this essence of the Merciful like a serpent and have neither believed nor recognized the truth. Why have you then agreed to kill and harm Him? By my Beauty, you have neither drunk from the cup of justice nor tasted from the ocean of my pleasure. You have not set foot in the abode of fairness and have not walked in the path of the insightful. You have considered misguidance as the essence of guidance and pure polytheism as the essence of unity. And all of you have clearly seen the soul preserved by God for twenty years, which is now present and has been protected by the grace of the Merciful, with knowledge of all that is within it, in the sanctuary of divine preservation. Despite this, you have risen to kill Him. When His will and action spread among the emigrants, to cover their vile actions and cast doubt into the hearts of the deluded, they engaged in forged fabrications and attributed their actions to the ancient pure one, hoping to divert the servants from the right path to the left of illusion.</p>
<p>You have denied what you have seen with your own eyes and understood, and you have remained veiled by the forged fabrications from the appearance of divine unity. By the glory of my exalted sanctity, what they have written about this Manifest Beauty is proof against all, demonstrating the lies of the speakers and establishing this clear matter, for they have mentioned attributes whose falsehood is clearer than the sun in the middle of the sky. All have associated with this exalted, most high Beauty and have understood to the extent of their capacity. Despite this, you have turned away from the divine revelations and explicit signs and, assuming they are truthful, have not acknowledged the right of God to do what He wills and have not agreed that He judges as He desires</p>
<p>.Beyond all these stages, those who accompanied me on this journey with God and have perceived many matters with their own eyes and hearts testify that the True, exalted is His essence, has always been and will always be distinguished from all others with all attributes. Yet, you have considered these souls liars and those who were never aware of the matter and never will be, and who walk the paths of illusion and suspicion, you have deemed truthful. Woe unto you, O assembly of the deluded! By my Beauty, the conclusive proof of God has been completed against all, and His perfect word has shone from the horizon of truth. Today, there is no refuge but His refuge and no shelter but His shelter. Hear the call of your Beloved and cling to what you have seen with your own eyes and break free from the cord of illusion. By God, if you observe with the sight of reality, you will see that the inhabitants of the Supreme Concourse are engaged in wailing and lamentation, and all the maidens of the chambers are in moaning and mourning. The leaves of the divine Lote Tree have withered from the oppression of these oppressors. By the True God, the breezes of divine mercy have been cut off from the realm of existence, and the radiance of the face of the Glorious One is forbidden to the dwellers of the universe.</p>
<p>By the True God, you have committed such an injustice that all things have been deprived of their life. Today, no creation remains, whether from the inhabitants of the Supreme Concourse, the cities of permanence, or those who are immersed in the ocean of names, except that all delicate things have been transformed into sorrow, and they have donned the garment of mourning. All the assembly of the cherubim and the realities of the Prophets and Messengers are engaged in lamentation in the chambers of exalted might, while you, O heedless ones of the earth, are joyful and wandering in the land of the lowest abyss. You have killed the essence of religion and think you are seated on the throne of faith and certainty. By God, O people, such a manifestation has never appeared, nor has the eye of creation seen it. Hear my call and do not be among the cautious ones who were in the assembly of the Furqan, to the extent that they were cautious of the breath of a mosquito, but issued fatwas for the shedding of the blood of God. They were engaged in remembrance, but when the verses of the Sovereign of Remembrance were revealed to them, they cried out to leave these remembrances and not distract them from the remembrance of God. These were the actions and deeds of that group, which became evident. And you, O people of the Bayan, in these days, are committing and practicing the essence of those deeds and consider yourselves from the truth and count yourselves among it.</p>
<p>Thus, I bear witness to God and His angels and His Prophets and His Messengers and those who circle around His throne and all that has been created in the heavens and the earth, that I have not failed in delivering My message to you. I have conveyed to you the messages of God at the time of My appearance and My ascent, and this moment in which I have manifested Myself from the horizon of the All-Glorious and bestowed upon you wisdom and explanation. I have made you know the Beauty of the Merciful and completed the proof for you, and the argument upon you, and the evidence within you. No mention remains except that I have cast upon you.</p>
<p>So, O my God, You know that I have not failed in Your command. I have conveyed to them what You commanded me before the creation of the heavens and the earth. I have shown them the paths of Your justice and revealed to them the ways of Your pleasure. So, O my God, have mercy on these people and do not make them among those who have turned away from me, denied my truth, and disputed my verses to the point of shedding my blood and severing my limbs. Therefore, O my God, support them in Your cause, then grant them victory with Your victory. Do not let them be deprived of these breezes that have blown from this Ridvan which You have created in the center of the paradises. Do not prevent them from the fragrances that have been sent from the horizon of Your name, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Then, O my God, ignite in their breasts the fire of attraction from the light of Your words, so that they may be turned by Your absolute power to the right side of Your Throne of Mercy. Then, O my God, set ablaze in their hearts the torches of Your love and longing, so that the veils which have hindered them from approaching Your presence and meeting You may be burned away. Then take, O my God, their hands with the hands of power and might, and save them from the depths of illusion and desire. Deliver them to the abode which You have sanctified from the signs of all that has been created between the earth and the heavens. Then cast upon them the word by which the hearts of the knowers are drawn to the heaven of Your mighty bounties and the hearts of the near ones to the air of the sanctity of Your grace.</p>
<p>Then make them, O my Beloved, among those whom nothing in the heavens and the earth can prevent from turning towards the direction of Your favor, standing firm on Your cause, acknowledging Your presence, and certifying their belief in meeting You. Indeed, You are the Forgiving, the Merciful, the Bestower, the Mighty, the Helper, the Generous.</p>
