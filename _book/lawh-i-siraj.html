<section id="sirajs-question-to-bahaullah" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sirajs-question-to-bahaullah">Siraj’s Question to Baha’u’llah</h2>
<p>The letter of that esteemed person is present in the presence of the Throne and has reached the place where “None can be known besides Him,” and what is in it is noted in the gaze of God. The question posed concerned how the Letters of ’Illiyyín could transform into the Letters of Sijjín, how affirmation could revert to negation, how the fruit of paradise could be barred from refinement, or how the mirror could be deprived of the illuminating rays of the sun of meanings.</p>
<p>Thou hast asked well, and thou art among those who question with sincere intention. Thy question is praiseworthy, for in this day it is imperative that anyone unable to grasp the mysteries of divine questions seek and aspire from the shore of divine knowledge and the ocean of the wisdom of the Eternal, hoping that a droplet from it might satiate him, that he might rest in the abode of calm and certitude.</p>
<p>We beseech God to raise thee to the station where thou canst witness the beauty of the Ancient with thine own sight, separate from the vision of others. That thou might hear His melodies with thine own ears, away from the hearts of those in the heavens and the earth. That He may purify thee from the filth of the world and its distractions so that wherever thou passest, thou hearest the proclamation, “There is none other God but Him!” The Radiant Countenance, in its splendor, is among the Hosts on high. Its brilliance shines between the earth and the heavens, and its grandeur is evident to those in the Kingdom of command and creation. Every being utters thus if thou art among those who listen.</p>
<p>Today it is incumbent upon every soul, from God, to observe with their eyes, ears, and hearts His Cause, to reflect, and to be enlightened and blessed by the radiant bounty of the Most Merciful and the grace of the Sublime One through the effulgence of the sun of meanings.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-people-are-unable-to-attain-the-presence-of-god" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-people-are-unable-to-attain-the-presence-of-god">Why People Are Unable to Attain the Presence of God</h2>
<p>The cause that has deprived all people of attaining the presence of God and preoccupied them with what is other than Him is that they have sufficed with mere illusions, content with what they have heard from others. They have walked the deadly paths of imitation and have been deprived of the avenues of detachment.</p>
<p>The Cause of God has been like the bright morning light. If some remain veiled from understanding it, it is because they have polluted their ears and hearts with the impurities of the words of men. Otherwise, if one looks at the true measure of divine knowledge, they will never be deprived of the path of guidance.</p>
<p>Now, esteemed one, consider: the matter has two aspects. Either the people of the Bayán acknowledge the power of God, or they do not. If they do not acknowledge it, then we have nothing to say to such souls, as they are among the former religions who consider “the hand of God is chained.” As the Lord of Majesty has informed us in His words:</p>
<section id="reason-1-the-hand-of-god-is-chained" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-1-the-hand-of-god-is-chained">Reason 1: The Hand of God is Chained</h3>
<p>“The hand of God is chained.” If they acknowledge the wondrous power of the Divine Lord, then being bound to such trivial matters would be futile and void, for helplessness is inherent to created beings while the Everlasting Essence remains ever upon the Throne of power and might. Should He so will, with a single word He could raise all the inhabitants of the earth to the heavens of His Cause or by another word lower them to the lowest state. No one can question His actions, and whoever does so denies God, turns away from His power, and fights against His authority.</p>
<p>In His holy scriptures, He also possesses the ability to raise any manifestation of His self among people whenever He wills. In the moment of His appearance, one should seek proof and evidence only from Him. If He provides the proof that has always been the means of confirming God’s religion and establishing His Cause among humanity, then any delay would be fruitless. If all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth were to linger, even for an instant, in acknowledging this Cause, they would be among those who have turned away from God and be considered among those denied.</p>
<p>He elevates whom He wills and brings low whom He wills. “He is not to be questioned about what He does.”</p>
<p>Reflect with fairness. If a soul manifests the entirety of divine power and further provides the proof that has always established God’s religion and His Cause, yet a person turns away from this divine appearance and not only does this but actively seeks to slay Him, what should be the judgment against such a soul? Say: God’s judgment is that He passes as He wishes, and He rules with justice, though people do not perceive it.</p>
</section>
<section id="reason-2-the-appearance-of-god-should-not-occur" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-2-the-appearance-of-god-should-not-occur">Reason 2: The Appearance of God Should Not Occur</h3>
<p>At no time or in any religion has such an act been permissible. God is the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Should they claim that this appearance should not occur, as the idolaters claimed, this would make God’s power dependent on people’s will. “Exalted is He above this, by a great elevation!”</p>
<p>During the manifestation sixty, all people, learned and unlearned, deprived themselves of the Truth through baseless and empty words and have thus changed the exalted station of everlasting existence into the lowest degradation of non-existence. They imagine themselves to be securely seated at the highest station of faith. “Wretched is what they have thought to themselves!”</p>
<p>Now, lift thine eyes above everything else and gaze upon the truth to behold what appears from Him. All besides Him is nothingness and shall remain so. If, today, all who are in the heavens and on the earth were to embody the Letters of the Bayán—a hundred thousand times greater than the Letters of the Qur’án—yet were to linger in this Cause, they would still be counted among those who have turned away from God. God, the Exalted and Almighty, is not likened, connected, or comparable to anyone. He remains sanctified above all others.</p>
<p>The radiance of the Sun of Grace shines equally upon all things, and all in creation are gathered before His grace, standing in a single plane. Not one particle has superiority over another, except in their priority of knowing and attaining God. Blessed are those who know Him by themselves and sever themselves from all besides Him.</p>
<p>O ’Alí, listen to the call of God and enter into His court, which is ever sanctified from names so that thou mayest not be deprived of the Countenance of His beauty or the sovereignty of the one who, by His will, created the Kingdom of names.</p>
<p>By God, besides whom there is no other, our intent with these words is to enable thee and a few others to tear away the veil and enter the sacred pavilion of the Beloved, sanctified from the suspicions and imaginations of humankind. Otherwise, He is exalted above their acceptance or rejection, and is independent of the world.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-3-the-sun-causes-stars-to-lose-their-light">Reason 3: The Sun Causes Stars to Lose Their Light</h3>
<p>When the sun shines, is it fitting for someone to ask how the stars lose their light, while observing that the light of the sun has rendered their illumination void? Yet, the stars prefer the darkness of night, avoiding the light of day, for their brightness is visible only at night. They vanish under the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>Glorified is He beyond all comparisons. His Sun of Beauty has always shone forth, with none beside Him. All besides Him are created upon this earthly plane and return to Him. He is ever-exalted, above all, and will ever remain so.</p>
</section>
<section id="reason-4-bewilderment-by-the-changes-of-names" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reason-4-bewilderment-by-the-changes-of-names">Reason 4: Bewilderment By the Changes of Names</h3>
<p>It is astonishing that people are bewildered by the changes of the names, despite seeing, with their own eyes, the changes in the manifestations and dawning-places of these divine names and attributes. They remain veiled by illusions and false words, unaware of the truths they see before their very eyes.</p>
<p>O questioner, do not imagine the names and attributes of God. Know that everything between the earth and the heavens are manifestations of His names and dawning-places of His attributes. Humanity was created with a higher rank than everything else.</p>
<p>Reflect on all these manifestations of divine names, trees, branches, blossoms, fruits, flowers, and everything adorning the face of the earth. In the beginning, they appear in full freshness and beauty. After some time, they all return to the earth. Many delectable fruits change so that their very scent becomes unbearable.</p>
<p>However, all change and elevation are exceptions for the comprehensive manifestations of God, who remain eternally present. The Sun of Meanings testifies that God speaks according to the understanding of the people.</p>
<p>Listen, if you wish, to these words and cast away the wings of imitation. Instead, with the wings of detachment, soar in the air of this holy unity. Listen attentively to the words of the All-Merciful, so that the heart may be purified from the dusty illusions that have beset all of creation. Thus will one return to the greatest vision.</p>
<p>When reaching this sacred and pure station, one will see that what is meant by the Bayán, which descended from the heaven of the previous manifestation, is this very appearance. “By Him in whose grasp is the soul of Husayn,” nothing greater than this Cause has been revealed in the Bayán. Consider this with clear and penetrating vision so that thou mayest comprehend the intent of the sacred divine words. In all writings and tablets, He has advised all people and taken a covenant from them that, upon the appearance of the Manifestation, they should not cling to that which is created and become veiled from the Manifestation itself. “For on that day, nothing will benefit except by His permission.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-excerpt-from-the-bayan">An Excerpt From the Bayan</h3>
<p>“And wait for the one who reminds you of God through his countenance. For you were created only for meeting Him, and He is the one who has connected everything to His command. Beware, beware in the days of His appearance lest you be veiled by the singularity of the Bayán, for that singularity is a created thing in His sight. Beware, beware lest you be veiled by the words revealed in the Bayán, for they are the words of His own self in the structure of His previous appearance.</p>
<p>Now, reflect on these words of the Sovereign of Names and Attributes. Do these firm verses and perfect words leave any room for anyone to turn away? “By Him who has caused the spirit to speak within my breast,” except for those who fully turn away from the Truth. The Bayán is the initial creation, and all beneath them were created in their shadow.</p>
<p>Vahíd Akbar also states, ‘And perhaps the one for whom you asked, regarding the exaltation of his name and the elevation of his Cause, will come to you. Those in the Bayán will read those words and will not turn to his appearance or believe in the God who created them in His previous manifestation. They slumber still.’”</p>

<p>As is evident now, everyone reads the Book of God and writes about it day and night, yet no one has truly sensed even a single letter from it. Their sole intention in promoting the Book is the establishment of authority and proving their own leadership. The Tongue of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing bears witness to this.</p>
<p>He says: “From the beginning of that matter until before the completion of nine created realities, nothing was revealed. From the sperm to that which We clothed with flesh, then be patient until you witness another creation.” Say, “Blessed be God, the best of creators!”</p>
<p>In another verse, He says: “This is what We promised you before. Be patient until the Bayán fulfills nine.” If so, say, “Blessed be God, the best of innovators!” He further declares: “Be observant of the distinction between the Qá’im and the Qayyúm. In the ninth year, all good things will be attained.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-distinction-between-the-qaim-and-the-qayyum">The Distinction Between the Qa’im and the Qayyum</h3>
<p>Now, reflect on these words and on the distinction between the Qá’im and the Qayyúm. I cannot explain these divine words due to the sorrows that have befallen me. By God, besides whom there is no other, I was compelled to write this tablet for the proclamation of God’s Cause, hoping that a few lamps might be illuminated and stand firm in aiding this wronged one by God’s power. “Everything weeps over my affliction and the injustice brought upon me by those who were created by My Word.”</p>
<p>Despite all this, I must still provide proofs for a Cause that has always been sanctified from requiring evidence, so that a few might ascend to the heavens of recognition. No greater injustice exists than to require the Ancient Beauty to prove His own legitimacy after His appearance is already clear as the noonday sun.</p>
<p>Soon will those who have wronged the Self of God realize the end to which they shall return. The calamities have reached such an extent that none but God can recount them. At every moment, the spears of enmity from adversaries pierce the eternal frame.</p>
<p>“The manifestations of the Self of God came to me this morning, weeping and wailing. They said, ‘Alas, for Joseph of God, the Mighty, the Everlasting! His servants have cast Him into the pit, and they rejoice within themselves.’ Say: ‘O people of the Bayán, do you kill the First Point while you read His verses morning and evening?’ By God, you have done what no nation has done before, and honored servants bear witness to this. Do you kill God with the swords of self and desire, yet continue to remember Him from your pulpits and use His verses to prove your point?”</p>
<p>Thus has every nation treated God when He appeared in the manifestation of His Self. They have done and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Say: “Today, the Pen of God, the Mighty, the Qayyúm, will not move on behalf of these names. The eye of God will not return to them, nor will the breaths of the Beloved’s holiness touch them.”</p>
<p>If the servants turn away from these divine verses and manifestations of the All-Sufficing, by what proof will they establish their religion? Say: “O people of the Bayán, observe with the sight of truth the greatest vision, for with any lesser sight, it cannot be seen.”</p>
<p>The Previous Manifestation said: “Beware! Look upon Him with His own eye. Whoever looks upon Him with another’s eye will never recognize Him.” After innumerable counsels, He tells His servants in this Cause: “O my God, You know that I have not withheld my counsel from these people nor failed to lead them to God, their Lord, and to faith in God, their Creator.”</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-soul-of-bahaullah-was-the-babs-sacrifice">The Soul of Baha’u’llah Was the Bab’s Sacrifice</h4>
<p>My soul is His sacrifice. By the beauty of the Eternal, these words from the Pen of the All-Merciful have set the hearts of all things ablaze, and anyone with vision will lament and grieve the manifestation of the Names and Attributes. But the wrongdoers gain only delusion and loss.</p>
<p>O ’Alí, open the ears of your heart and listen to the words of the All-Merciful revealed in the Qayyúm of Names. He says: “O Light of My Eye, do not fully open your hand over the Cause, for people are drunk on the mystery. Yet, your return will occur after this cycle through the Greater Truth. Then, reveal a mystery according to the eye of a needle in the Greater Mount, so that those of the Mount will perish in the Sinai at the rising of a drop from that crimson light.”</p>
<p>In this verse, He shows that the people of the Mount will die and be nothing. How then can one marvel when the fruit of the Tree of Bliss turns bitter, just as was asked about the transformation of the realities of ’Illiyyín to Sijjín?</p>

<section id="the-sovereignty-of-god" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sovereignty-of-god">The Sovereignty of God</h3>
<p>The Cause of God is not and will not be confined. If the mirrors of creation stand before the sun of the Ancient Heaven at the time of its rising, the rays of the sun will appear, imprint, and manifest in them all. But if they turn away, they will be left deprived. “Gaze upon the sun and then at the mirrors to find the path to that which the spirit brings.”</p>
<p>Ibn Nabíl has written proofs of God’s Cause based on what God has placed in his heart. He began by citing the verse that descended from the will of the previous Manifestation: “Say: ‘O God, You are the God of gods. You bestow divinity upon whom You will and strip it from whom You will.’” And: “Say: ‘O God, You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth. You bestow lordship upon whom You will and remove it from whom You will.’”</p>
<p>Even though the Sovereign of existence clearly declared that divinity and lordship are bestowed upon anyone He wills, and taken from anyone He wishes, is not God, who can grant or remove the highest stations of divinity and lordship, able to take His own name from a form or transform something sweet into bitter? “Exalted is God above what the people imagine about His power!”</p>
<p>Look and see where the bird of power and majesty flies, and where people have made their abode. How do they interpret the verse, ‘He is capable of all things,’ and understand the phrase, ‘He does as He wills and is not questioned’?</p>
<p>O servants, detach yourselves from the flimsiest of houses and seek the dawn of divine knowledge. I wish the people of the Bayán would reflect on the blessed verse mentioned by Ibn Nabíl. Perhaps they would abandon paths of illusion and tread the path of certainty.</p>
<p>O ’Alí, drink from this sweet, life-giving water hidden in the dark expressions of the Sovereign of Names and Attributes, so that you may purify yourself from the defilements of the days, illusions of the people, hints of the heedless, and arguments of the fanatical. Then, the infinite doors of divine knowledge will open to your heart. You will become assured that the Sovereign of Eternity is capable of honoring all beings in an instant with the robes of divine names and stripping them of it in another instant.</p>
<p>“I complain to God about these people, for they look upon me based on what they have rather than what I have. They compare the Self of God to their selves and His words to their words.”</p>
<p>By Him in whose grasp is my soul, if today everyone in the heavens and on earth were to turn to God, He would teach them from the wonders of His knowledge and enrich them from everything besides Him.</p>
<p>In this year of trials, some servants have asked such questions. I wrote firm, clear, and sufficient answers, but it seems that you have not seen them. Some have spread doubts here, attempting to veil holy souls with words from previous revelations. However, they forget that a soul soaring in the vast air of divine holiness and reaping from the fields of infinite divine knowledge is not veiled by imaginary doubts.</p>
<p>“Say: ‘Whoever arrives at the greatest sea will not turn to the mirage of a desert or drink from the boiling waters.’” Although it is not fitting for the Supreme Pen to mention the words of those who harbor enmity or to respond, I am compelled to fulfill the messages of the Lord, hoping that an ignorant one may reach the sea of knowledge or that a wanderer lost in the valleys of heedlessness may be guided by the grace of the All-Merciful. “Indeed, He guides whom He wills to the path of glory.”</p>
<p>This mention and explanation are only for those truly seeking the path of guidance. Otherwise, the contaminated spring cannot purify a heart filled with hatred.</p>
<p>Most of the people of the Bayán have seen and heard all the divine manifestations of power and revealed verses, yet they arise in hatred to such an extent that one cannot mention it. “Except for the one whom God has opened his vision and aided in His Cause.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disbelievers-cling-to-matters-never-mentioned-by-god">Disbelievers Cling to Matters Never Mentioned by God</h3>
<p>They cling to matters that were never mentioned before God and are so heedless that they prostrate themselves before a stone while turning away from the greatest vision and the most luminous, pure beauty.</p>
<p>“By the Lord worshipped by His servants, a hair from a true worshipper is better than them.”</p>
<p>O ’Alí, say today: “You and your objects of worship are equal before God. Whoever among you believes has been saved from the great terror, and whoever turns away has strayed from the path of God. This is the truth, and after the truth is only error.”</p>
<p>“Beware, beware, O people of the Bayán, do not deny God or fight against the Manifestation of His Self. Do not dispute with the one who came from the dawn of the Cause with clear authority.”</p>
<p>Do you believe that God’s Cause will be hindered by those who reject it, or that the lights of the eternal sun will be veiled by the clouds of dark souls? By Him who spoke within me, nothing can prevent His Cause, and He sent me with the truth to the people.</p>
<p>Some idolaters have spread the false idea that gold cannot turn to copper. Say: “By my Lord, we have knowledge of this and teach whom we wish through our own knowledge. Whoever is in doubt should ask God to witness it and be among the convinced.”</p>
<p>If copper is able to reach the station of gold, it is clear proof that gold can return to its original state if people understood. All metals share similarities in weight, shape, and matter, but knowledge of this remains hidden within the Book.</p>
<p>The knowledge of those who reject this Cause has not reached the station that allows them to comprehend that gold can turn into copper, nor have they grasped that all metals can become dust. Every person of understanding knows that all things emerge from dust and return to dust, which is cheaper than copper. Dust is an element, while copper is a substance.</p>
<p>Had the people been receptive and mature, some of these hidden divine sciences would have been revealed. However, fate has been decreed.</p>
<p>It is clear to every discerning soul that God, exalted be His mention, has been and will continue to be capable of all things. He can turn gold into copper by His mere will. Weakness is present in the created, yet He is the All-Powerful, Mighty, Praised One.</p>
<p>Purify your gaze and focus on the greatest vision. Detach yourself from barren trees that neither enrich nor bear fruit. This is among the wondrous commands of God. “Whoever wishes may accept, and whoever wishes may turn away. Whoever accepts does so for himself, and whoever turns away harms only himself.”</p>
<p>“He is sanctified above all people.”</p>

<p>Consider Satan, who was the teacher of the spiritual realms and was known in the assemblies of the exalted names by the Most Beautiful Names. However, after turning away from the Most High, he took his place in the lowest earthly realm. Thus, your Lord does what He wills if you are of those who believe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the Ancient House (Kaaba), the sacred shrine of all creation, which was circumambulated by the manifestations of the Names and Attributes. Why was it deprived of this supreme bounty? Reflect, O people of insight.</p>
<p>All things are in the grasp of the divine power, and at every moment, He can bring forth whatever He wishes. His encompassing might is never taken from the manifestations of existence. His hidden mysteries cannot be understood by every ear, nor can His intellectual maidens be observed by every eye.</p>

<p>How many forms of tyranny have been clothed in the garb of justice, and how many just truths have been wrongly known in garments of oppression? Look at the idols before whom half the people of the earth now prostrate themselves and take as gods other than God. They have been afflicted with this ailment because they relied on imagination and imitation while turning away from the Sovereign of Unity.</p>
<p>Today, the manifestations of all Names and Attributes are evident in one station, except for those who ascend to God. Thus do We reveal to you so that you may cleanse yourself from the words of the people and hear the melodies of the Spirit on the branches of this tree that surrounds all who are in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>Say, O people of the Bayán, by God, the True One, this has not come from Myself but from what God spoke within My heart. What has appeared from My authority and what has flowed from My pen are My proof and My argument if you are just.</p>
<p>Say, by what proof did you believe in ’Alí before, when He appeared with the truth and came to you with clear authority? By what evidence did you confirm His verses, submit to His proof, and humble yourselves at the appearances of His mighty, exalted, and illuminating Cause?</p>
<p>If you say, “We believed in Him by Himself and sufficed with His own proof,” then say: “By God, He now stands before humanity, appearing with the authority of His name, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Great.”</p>
<p>If you say, “We believed in what was revealed to Him from the verses of God, the Almighty, the All-Powerful,” then those verses have filled the earth from east to west.</p>
<p>Listen to what is revealed from the holy direction, where one hears its breeze as did the Beloved on the Ascension of Holiness, the Spirit in the Heavens of the Cause, and Moses on the Mount of Might, when the Tree of God, the Speaking, Mighty, Wise One, called out.</p>

<p>Say to the leaders of the Bayán: Where were you when the souls of humanity were disturbed, and the feet faltered, and terror covered the hearts of the steadfast? People of various sects rose against all humanity, and I sought help from no one but God, who raised and sent me to the worlds.</p>
<p>By God, they hid behind the veils of women. When the Cause appeared with its authority, they were reassured and came out of hiding. But their first action was to turn away from the One by whom their faith was confirmed. Thus was the matter, and you are a witness.</p>
<p>If you do not believe Me after what you have seen with your eyes, then all things will testify to Me, followed by the Tongue of God, the Truthful, Trustworthy One.</p>
<p>O Glory of Majesty, change the melody for those of creation. Sing on the branches of eternity in a mighty, non-Arabic tone to reveal the secrets of the Cause through what has been written by this firm, unyielding pen. Not all people are familiar with the Arabic tongue, and understanding Persian is easier for them.</p>

<section id="transformation-from-illiyim-to-sijjin" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transformation-from-illiyim-to-sijjin">Transformation from Illiyim to Sijjin</h3>
<p>O questioner, all the names you see in the Book of God, such as the Tree of Bliss, the Lote-Tree of the Limit, the Ultimate Tree, and its leaves and fruits, are not imaginary. They signify those who believe in God and will continue to do so. As long as the believer resides under the shade of the Divine Tree, they are counted among the Tree of Bliss and ’Illiyyín before God.</p>
<p>However, after turning away from the Tree, they are mentioned among the fires of Sijjín. While faithful, their branches, leaves, and fruits are evident as signs of affirmation. But after turning away, they are all regarded as symbols of negation.</p>
<p>There is a soul that is rooted in the Tree of Eternity during the evening but remains by the lowest tree of annihilation at dawn. Conversely, the opposite is true if you understand. Observe a believer in the state of devotion to God like a well-adorned paradise, filled with what you have heard about in paradise: branches of knowledge, fruits of divine insight, streams of eloquence, and flowers of wisdom. Above all this, according to God’s will, everything will be found in it.</p>
<p>The same soul, after turning away, becomes the self of hell, along with all that was connected to it. Thus does God transform light into darkness and darkness into light if you comprehend.</p>
<p>“Have you not heard that the previous Manifestation established this law on the earth? He declared that any land where no believer resides is counted as an inferno. Now, the throne of the earth has been placed upon a land that was previously unknown. However, those who hate the Beauty of the Lord of the Worlds have deprived themselves of the heights of ’Illiyyín and have settled in the depths of Sijjín, thinking themselves to be in the highest place in paradise. Previous religions were also occupied with these illusions.</p>
<p>“The Pen of the Cause gives them the good news of the torment of an inauspicious day. These people are content to take calves other than God and prostrate themselves before them, but they are not worthy of soaring in the holy air of the Eternal or returning to the heavens of divine glory. The one whose nature has turned to clay is always drawn to it.</p>
<p>“God presents this as an example so that people may comprehend.”</p>
<p>Have you not heard that He says, “Many a tree of affirmation becomes a tree of denial in the next Manifestation”? Today, any soul that does not sever itself from all that is seen among people and recognize it as mere clay will never be able to soar in this atmosphere or ascend to the abode of the sovereign glory of holiness.</p>

<section id="believers-have-always-been-rare" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="believers-have-always-been-rare">Believers Have Always Been Rare</h3>
<p>Believers have always been fewer than the rare red sulfur. The suns of meanings have shone from the horizons of the divine finger. The fruit does not exist in itself but is lifted from the earthly realm by divine assistance, reaching this station where it may become fruitful. That One who granted this station by His power can, in less than a moment, cause it and a hundred thousand like it to descend from the highest station of permanence to the lowest station of extinction, and vice versa. This has always been and will always be His way.</p>
<p>His encompassing power and predestined decrees have forever prevailed over all things. His appearances are never hindered by the weakest of illusions. “Glorified is God above what those who imagine think.”</p>
<p>Many pearls of mystery are hidden within the shells of the seas of the Lord, the Concealer’s names. Their revelation would lead to the stumbling of those not on the straight path.</p>
<p>Today, a bounty has appeared such that if He wills, He can raise the primal and ultimate letters from a handful of clay. Yet, it is a great pity if a person in this day, when the Beauty of the All-Merciful has fully manifested, occupies themselves with anything but Him.</p>
<p>“Leave all who are in the heavens and on the earth to their own, then immerse yourself in the depths of this ocean, where nothing is found but the pearls of the remembrance of your Lord, the Exalted, the All-Powerful, the Great.”</p>
<p>This is the wondrous appearance of the Sun of the All-Merciful’s Cause shining from the horizon of the King of the Possible’s finger. Blessed are the people of the world!</p>
<p>Beyond that, “your Lord is free from all people.””</p>
<p>Many souls today are drowning in the seas of fire without realizing it, yet believe themselves to be among the people of paradise. The previous communities have also rejoiced in such illusions.</p>
<p>“By the Sun of Glory of the Sanctified,” this appearance is too great to need proof or depend on arguments. “Say: Its proof is its appearance, its argument is itself, and its existence is its affirmation. Its argument is its establishment between the heavens and the earth during the days when all those in the Kingdom of command and creation were disturbed.”</p>
<p>If you cannot recognize it based on what has been explained to you, then recognize it by what has been revealed from Him. “Thus has been given to you a bounty from Him. He is the Generous, the Ancient.”</p>
<p>“The Supreme Pen says: ‘O ’Alí, step once upon the Mount of Holiness with a pure heart and tongue. Say, “O Lord, show me,” so that you may forever witness and hear the One beyond compare and attain to the Presence of the Glorious One. That is, meeting the Manifestation of His Self, so that a single ray of the lights of His grace will cause the trees of existence to sing from the seen and unseen with what the Lote Tree of the Mount has proclaimed.’ Thus has the grace of the Sovereign encompassed, and people are in a great illusion and thick veil.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disbelievers-pride-themselves-on-the-word-yet-turn-away-from-his-self">Disbelievers Pride Themselves on the Word Yet Turn Away From His Self</h3>
<p>This is the state of those who always pride themselves on the Word of Truth yet turn away from His Self. They circumambulate a stone and travel the difficult paths from far places, giving up their wealth and lives to visit it. But they turn away from the Sovereign by whose Word hundreds of thousands of these stones are created.</p>
<p>In the sixtieth year, and again in these days, they veil the clear sight with a hundred thousand veils of illusion and veils of self. Then they cry out that the shining sun of eternal glory has not risen. If they understand, they ask how such a star can be erased or extinguished, yet forget that the sun’s light removes the stars’ light. In the daytime, the stars’ light is obliterated and unseen.</p>
<p>“Soon, the divine hand of encompassing power will create souls that will tear all veils and enter the sacred sanctuary of the Lord of Lords without any cover or screen.”</p>
<p>They will not be quenched by any water or falter before any fire on the path of the Beloved. They will regard all besides the Worshipped One as non-existent and see everything but their Goal as void. At all times, they will drag the people of creation to the Most Merciful’s garden with chains of explanation.</p>
<p>“By the Sun of Meanings, the light of these souls will illuminate the hosts on high, just as the sun shines upon the people of the earth.</p>
<p>‘O ’Alí, leave what you have and take what God commands you. This will suffice you over all people, and anything else neither satisfies nor enriches.’</p>
<p>Hold fast to the strongest handle and leave what desire commands you. “By God, the True One, this is the firm rope between the earth and the sky. Whoever holds to it will be saved, and whoever turns away will perish.”</p>
<p>If any soul seeks the exalted Truth besides Him, it is like a blind person seeking guidance on the path. “This will never happen. His proof is His verses and His authority is His affirmation.”</p>
<p>’O ’Alí, listen to the divine words in the beautiful Persian language. If you do not listen, God’s encompassing power will create souls to hear His call and rise to aid His Cause. “This is not difficult for God.”</p>
<p>If you return from the north of illusion to the right of certainty and are nourished by the fountain of knowledge of the All-Merciful’s Beauty that flows in the paradise of meanings, say, “O people of the Bayán, what religion are you practicing, and upon which path do you stand?”</p>
<p>If they say, “We are devoted to the Point of the Bayán,” ask them what proof or evidence led them to be certain of and confess to that Sovereign. If they say, “We know Him by Himself,” then this is an open lie because they have not yet known themselves, let alone the Self of God that stands over all things.</p>
<p>And if this saying is heard from them, why then do they not acknowledge the manifest Self of God, who is as radiant as the sun? If they say they believe in the revealed verses, why have they rejected the verses that are like a pouring downpour descending continuously from the unseen sky?</p>
<p>“Say, do you believe in part of the Book and deny the other part? Woe unto you, you people of injustice!”</p>
<p>Beyond these two stations, there are the manifestations of power and the aspects of divinity that encompass the world so thoroughly that no one can deny them except by completely rejecting God, His prophets, His chosen ones, and His friends.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty years have passed without this servant ever resting peacefully, and at all times, He has worked to raise the Cause of God. “By the Sovereign that none know, since the beginning of creation until now, no such power has appeared that a single soul has raised the banners of greatness and majesty.</p>
<p>Even so, the idolaters have done to the Manifest Beauty of the Lord of the Worlds what now causes the Holy Spirit to lament and wail in the heavenly forms of ’Illiyyín. If they say these wondrous verses did not descend from the divine nature, just as the idolaters have said about the suns of truth, say, “the tablets that have been revealed from the clouds…”</p>
