<p>He is the Most Radiant, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>In the Name of God, the Most Supreme, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Your letter has reached the Presence of the Throne, and We have become aware of its contents. We shall grant you that which benefits you—for your Lord is indeed the All-Knowing, the All-Aware. In the Tablet, a lofty station has been ordained for you. By My life! If you were to recognize it, you would soar with longing and sever yourself from all created things. Blessed is the one who has perceived the fragrance of the garment and has turned toward God, the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
<p>Preserve your station, then recite the verses of your Lord; by them the hearts of the sincere are enkindled. Let nothing cause you sorrow. Remain steadfast in the love of your Lord, and remember Him among His servants—for He remembers you in His sacred, glorious, and exalted dominion. Blessed are you for having attained to the knowledge of your Lord in His days, and for having believed in Him after those who were created by His command—the Most Exalted, the Mighty, the Wondrous—had disbelieved in Him.</p>

<p>In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Supreme, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to the expanse of His Presence—the One Who brought existence into being, Who illumined the world with the light of the Greatest Name. In the realm of meaning, and the meaning of meaning, and the meaning of the meaning of meaning, there is no secret, no truth, no enduring word, save that it has streamed forth from His Most Exalted Pen, manifest and radiant. Exalted be His glory, vast His bounty, and great His station. There is no god but Him. Blessings, peace, magnification, glory, remembrance, and praise rest upon His chosen ones—those who have not broken His covenant nor His pact, and who have arisen to serve His mighty, wondrous Cause.</p>
<p>And now, O My beloved—this is the sixth letter that has been sent. The handwriting of that beloved one was received: the first dated the 17th of Rabiʻ al-Awwal, the second on the 10th of Jumada al-Awwal, and the third on the 5th of Jumada al-Thani. The arrival of the gift of the Bayán into the garden of meanings was read in full. The breezes of love flowed from it, and the wafts of sincerity moved with its stirring. Every word therein was a faithful witness, a trustworthy proof, of the devotion, attention, and service of His Eminence, the Trustee.</p>
<p>After the reading and comprehension, the intent turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. Permission was then requested, and through the listening of the Beloved of the world, that goal was attained. This is what the All-Merciful has sent down in response—words of the Lord, exalted and sanctified:</p>
<p>I am the Expounder, the Wise.</p>
<p>O Trustee, blessed is the word that, in the Days of God, attained to the hearing of the Desired One. Blessed is the letter that stood in His sacred presence. Blessed is the utterance that became manifest in His city. Say: If you were to count the bounties of God, you could never number them. That which was veiled from hearts and eyes became manifest and made plain. The path became visible, the command apparent—without suspension or delay. The radiances of the sun of His grace have reached and shall continue to reach. The lamps of the Cause have appeared in His Name, and the signs of might have been revealed by His command. He is the One, the Almighty Speaker.</p>
<p>To the people of God, male and female, who dwell in the cities of the True One—exalted be His glory, that is, the cities of faith and certainty—convey to each of them a proclamation of magnification and peace. Give glad tidings of the lights of the sun of divine bounty, and remind them of the traces of the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>Blessed are you, O Trustee—My Pen has borne witness that you attained presence, encounter, vision, and attentive hearing. Be like a downpour for the lands, and the April rain of bounty for the servants.</p>
<p>We entreat the True One to adorn His people with the robe of detachment, that they may arise with full endeavor to serve and turn toward the guidance of those on earth. Say: O people of the world! Hearken to the call of the Wronged One and cling to that which is worthy. For every soul, the path of God is known and clear, like the sun, its radiance shining and its illumination manifest.</p>
<p>Whosoever arises to serve, the atoms of the universe, the dwellers of the highest Paradise and the most sublime Garden, all beseech the True One to confirm and grant him success. By the grace of the True One—exalted be His glory—lift your feet from the place of limitation and set them in the realm beyond place. This station is detachment from all things and steadfastness in service.</p>
<p>Today, the Light is calling out, Sinai is proclaiming good news, the fruits are saying: “O trees!” This is the day of joy, the day of rejoicing and delight—for the Beloved has appeared and is beheld. What a wondrous attraction has seized the world, and what a wondrous rapture is among the Supreme Concourse. The carpet of gladness is spread in perfect exultation.</p>
<p>Blessed is the tongue that remembers Him, and the ear that receives the melodies of the things. O possessors of hearing, the birds of the highest Paradise are singing! O possessors of sight, the lights of the Greatest Name are manifest! Do not deprive yourselves. Know the value of these days. The Most Exalted Pen is, night and day, occupied with the remembrance of the people of God. Blessed are they, and theirs is the most excellent return. Unto God belongs the command at the beginning and at the end.</p>
<p>Praise be to God! That beloved one attained what had been the hope of the near ones and the longing of the sincere. This was recorded in mention of the honored and veiled lady—his aunt and daughter—upon them be the glory of God. Likewise was mentioned the Hajjis of the land of Káf—upon them be the glory of God—and the gathering at the home of Khadíjah Sultan.</p>
<p>Upon her be the glory of God—each with honor was presented in the presence of the Lord and attained to acceptance. Each was mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur. This is a great blessing—recognize its station. Some time ago, His Holiness <em>Ismu’lláh M…</em>—upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious—spoke of a gathering. After its acceptance, He acted upon it that very night. His mention then flowed from the Most Exalted Pen and was dispatched.</p>
<p>As for what was written about Áqá Sayyid Farajulláh—upon him be the glory of God—and his love and steadfastness, this was presented, and the sun of bounty then shone from the horizon of grace. Previously, too, <em>Ismu’lláh</em> had carried out, on their behalf, what had been mentioned. As for what was recorded regarding the sons of Khalíl and the heir of Kalím—upon them be the glory of God—in the lands and the letter M, in the days when that beloved had attained the honor of presence, a blessed tablet had been revealed for them from the heaven of Will, but due to wisdom, it had not yet been sent. Now it is being dispatched.</p>
<p>We beseech God to confirm them in the supreme steadfastness, for the screechers and the unjust—like scattered locusts—have dispersed through cities and regions. We ask God to protect all by His bounty and grace. He is the Generous, the Noble.</p>
<p>As for what was written regarding this servant’s letter, dated the 26th of Rabiʻ al-Awwal, having been received, and the one before not yet having arrived—the copy of what was sent is extant. On the 11th of Rabiʻ al-Awwal, a letter from this servant was dispatched, adorned with the divine verses, spanning nine pages. Hopefully it has been received by now.</p>
<p>Regarding the beloved of the spirit, Jináb Áqá Yahyá—upon him be the glory of God—you wrote: any person with sight and fairness, if they were to meet him, would say what Jináb Áqá Yahyá has said. Yet due to the veils of self and passion, love of leadership, discord, and sedition, they say what leads only to the misguidance of the poor people—just like the slanders of former days, when a few heedless souls, driven by love of position, turned away from the Truth and, with their vain statements, plunged the helpless servants into a wilderness of confusion, division, and lies.</p>
<p>Everything they have said is false—like the tale of <em>Náḥiyih</em>, <em>Jábulqá</em>, <em>Jábalsá</em>, and other such things. These phrases have been repeatedly mentioned in the letters of the friends, in the hope that some might awaken and not fall again into the illusions of the past.</p>
<p>In these days, Ahmad Kirmání, son of Mullá Jaʻfar, and Áqá Khán have gone to the island and conspired with the source of delusions. They have returned. Now consider: if those souls had shown even a little fairness, and had moved for the sake of God, they should have come to this land, from which—since the beginning of the Cause until now—the call of the Truth has been raised with the loftiest cry.</p>
<p>To the lady from the people of <em>Káf</em>, they said, “We shall also come to ʻAkká.” Yet they did not come. Glory be to God! They appeared with deceit and schemes that no one but God can count. God is witness, and His chosen ones bear testimony, that these souls were never, from the very beginning, aware of the Cause, nor are they now.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, leave them to amuse themselves in their vain talk. The purpose of these words is solely to inform that beloved one—nothing more.</p>
<p>In this very moment, the Face is turned and present, and the Tongue of Grandeur speaks this word:</p>
<p>“O Trustee, upon you be My glory.”</p>
<p>Continually, in the letters you have sent to this servant, there is mention of unity, harmony, affection, love, and devotion to the people of God—particularly those souls chosen among the servants and honored with special bestowals. Yet until now, that which is worthy has not been seen. Alas, if only they had acted upon the counsels of the Most Exalted Pen—for the sake of God, and severed from the whispers of self and desire—then the land would not be what it is, nor the people who they are.</p>
<p>We ask God—and we must ask—until that which is worthy becomes manifest. Today, detachment and piety are the helpers and defenders of the Cause. Blessed is the one who attains to both. So ask God to support them with the hosts of remembrance and to inspire them with what is fitting for them in the days of their Lord—the Clarifier, the All-Knowing, the Wise.</p>
<p>O beloved of My heart! At this moment, this servant is so sorrowful for the Beauty of the Eternal that, truly, I have preferred non-existence to existence. For a condition has been witnessed such that the tongue is powerless to describe it, and the pen incapable of expressing it. And God suffices as a witness.</p>
<p>As for your note about meeting the friends of God in every land—after presenting this to the sacred court, the following was spoken:</p>
<p>“The Trustee—upon him be My glory—is a cause of remembrance among the servants and, in all conditions, a well-wisher to all.”</p>
<p>We ask God to confirm him, God willing, that in all states he may gaze upon the honor of the Cause. The discharge of rights is obligatory upon all. Its benefit returns to the very souls of the servants. Yet its acceptance depends on the spirit, the fragrance, and the satisfaction of just and righteous souls. In that case, taking is permitted—otherwise, no. Indeed, your Lord is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. -End</p>
<p>Regarding the spiritual beloved Jináb ʻAndalíb—upon him be the glory of God—and the favor bestowed upon him, you wrote: praise be to God, he is confirmed in the service of the Cause. The beloved of My heart, Jináb Samandar—upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious—has repeatedly mentioned him. In recent days, both his prose and verse were presented in the sacred presence. The Tablet of his poem was graciously received among the dwellers of the Pavilion of Purity and Majesty. Indeed, our Lord is the Bestower, the Generous.</p>
<p>Give him glad tidings—his name, his teaching, and his service are continually remembered. This servant beseeches his Lord to confirm him in all conditions.</p>
<p>You also wrote of the sincerity, love, and fervor of the honored woman, the daughter of the late Ḍilʿ Marfūʻ La-Muḥammad Jaʻfar—upon them be the glory of God—as well as of Ḥájí Abú’l-Qásim—upon him be the glory of God—and his devotion. Blessed are they! Praise be to God, by the grace of the All-Glorious, they are confirmed. Their names have been explicitly mentioned by the Tongue of Grandeur.</p>
<p>Give all glad tidings of divine bounty. This servant, too, sends greetings and exaltation to each of them, and beseeches the All-Glorious Lord on their behalf for that which is enduring and everlasting.</p>
<p>You mentioned Jináb Mírzá Mihdí—upon him be the glory of God—and his love and steadfastness, and also the one with him, who was named after him. Praise be to God, they are, in these days, mentioned in the sacred court, and their names were included in verses revealed from the heaven of Will for the beloved of My heart, Jináb Varqá—upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious.</p>
<p>It has been revealed and dispatched. God willing, they have attained and shall attain to it, and will be adorned with the radiances of the sun of the divine Bayan. Truly, our Lord the All-Merciful is the Firm, the All-Knowing, the Compassionate, the Generous.</p>
<p>As requested by that beloved, this servant attained the honor of pilgrimage on their behalf. We beseech God, exalted be He, to make the letters of our deeds and hopes into a Book from His presence. He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>In another letter from that beloved, you mentioned arrival at <em>Rā</em> and <em>Shīn</em>, and the friends in those lands, and their fervor and steadfastness in the love of God. After its presentation before the Lord of the Day of Resurrection, these verses shone forth from the dawning-place of bounty:</p>
<p>O My loved ones in Rā and Shīn! Hear the call of God, the King, the True, the Manifest. There is no god but Me, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Today, the things are singing, and the nightingales of the Bayan are warbling upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of gnosis. Each thing has chosen a place and is therein occupied with the remembrance of the Lord—glorified be He. Drawn by the fragrance of the verses of the Possessor of Names and Attributes and by the longing for the appearance of the Manifestation of Proofs, all are enraptured. The verses of joy and gladness have taken hold of all. Yet most among the servants remain heedless.</p>
<p>O people of God! Though the tongues of the world are powerless and incapable of uttering what is befitting of the Lord of the Sacred Beauty, since all have been commanded to mention and praise, the grace of God—glorified be He—toward you is as radiant and resplendent as the sun. He created, nurtured, guided upon the straight path, and gave a share from the cup of His love.</p>
<p>By the life of God! The Supreme Concourse is, at all times, occupied with the remembrance of the people of Bahá. The Tongue of Grandeur in His praiseworthy station bears witness to this.</p>
<p>We beseech God to grant you success and confirm you in that which you have been commanded in the Book. May He provide you with the means of both earth and heaven, bring you near to Himself, and counsel you to love and unity, to wisdom and eloquence. He is indeed the Commander, the Wise.</p>
<p>Act always with perfect unity and accord, and do not let go of wisdom. Strife and discord are condemned.</p>
<p>O people of God! Assist the Wronged One through deeds and character. This is what has been revealed in many Tablets from God, the Lord of the worlds. May the glory be upon you and upon those who were not hindered by the oppression of the world from turning to God, the Lord of the nations. —End—</p>
<p>You also mentioned the <em>Five Sayyids</em>—upon them be the glory of God. This is what was revealed for them from the realm of Might by our Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous:</p>
<p>O Trustee, upon you be My glory.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the aforementioned Sayyids—upon them be My glory—have repeatedly attained honor through the verses of the Most Exalted Pen. Give them glad tidings of My remembrance at this moment. Verily, We have remembered those who turned toward God, the Lord of the worlds. We ask God to grant them success and to inscribe for them that which benefits them in this world and the next. He is the Hearer, the Responsive. —End—</p>
<p>You also mentioned Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Ḥusayn Ḍ-R—upon him be the glory of God. After that presentation, these verses descended from the dawning-place of the mercy of our Lord, the All-Merciful:</p>
<p>We have mentioned him before, and before even that, and We have confirmed him in turning toward God, the One, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>He has continually been remembered in the sacred court. In these days, a Tablet was revealed specifically for him and sent through <em>Ismu’lláh M…</em>. Give him glad tidings of My bounty, grace, and mercy. —End—</p>
<p>In truth, during the days when he was present in Fars they were continually engaged in remembrance and steadfast in service. Truly, He does not cause the reward of the righteous to be lost. This servant sends them greetings, praise, and glorification.</p>
<p>You mentioned the land of Qáf and the friends of the True One there, and their gatherings; likewise, the gathering held by Jináb Ḥájí Muḥammad 14—upon them be the glory of God. After presentation in the sacred court, this statement descended from the Kingdom of Proof:</p>
<p>Blessed are the souls who are engaged in serving the friends of God. Praise be to God, the friends in the land of Qáf are each confirmed by His grace and illumined by the light of the sun of steadfastness. We mention them all and give them glad tidings.</p>
<p>O Jawád, upon you be My glory. The Trustee has mentioned you. We ask God to confirm you in all conditions and to cause, from the fruits of certitude, wondrous trees to grow in the blessed pure land—and from those trees, to bring forth other fruits and leaves. He is the Powerful, the Able—there is no god but Him, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.</p>
<p>O Jawád, rejoice in My mention of you and My turning toward you from the direction of the prison. Nothing equals My remembrance among all things. This is testified by the Mother Book in His presence. —End—</p>
<p>As for what was written regarding the beloved of My heart, Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥaydar-ʻAlí—upon him be the All-Glorious glory—and his rank of service, trust in God, detachment, devotion, steadfastness, and constancy: truly, he is just as that beloved has written. Praise be to God, he is adorned with noble character, upright in the Cause, kindled with the luminous Light and with the Fire of the Lote Tree.</p>
<p>From the Almighty Lord, exalted be His station, I ask for him that which shall not be effaced from the horizon of the Book of God.</p>
<p>As for your mention of Shaykh Muḥammad of Kirmānshāh: he is among the great rejecters. Poor man, he rushes blindly and has no knowledge of matters. He clings to what he has heard from the heedless. Ḥájí Ibráhím from Qáf associates day and night with the hypocrites.</p>
<p>O beloved of My heart! Steadfastness is like the Simurgh—its name is known, but its form is hidden. Most are stirred by any wind. We ask God to open the eye of fairness and to grant honesty. It is truly regrettable that in these days, the servants are deprived of the ocean of the Bayán. The Cause is in His hands—He does what He wills and decrees what He desires. He is the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning the funds that were to be delivered to some: truly, each of these matters involves tests in the path of good works, especially in this land burdened by straits and countless expenses. Whatever arrives must conform to the Will of God—glorified be He—that it may reach souls content and pleasing, so they may, in full independence, engage in teaching, education, and reform among the tribes.</p>
<p>In this moment, this exalted word has descended from the dawning-place of supreme bounty:</p>
<p>Whoever today desires to aid the Cause—meaning, to engage in teaching—must first be adorned with the robe of detachment. We beseech God to grant success to all in that which befits His days. —End—</p>
<p>As for what you wrote regarding the noble leaf <em>Thamara</em>—upon her be the glory of God—after presentation in the sacred court, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered this blessed word:</p>
<p>O Trustee, upon you be My glory. The countenance of <em>Hudhud</em>—upon her be My glory—was commanded to deliver <em>Thamara</em>’s matter, for she was the intermediary. But the matter concerning Mírzá Muḥammad was written exclusively for him and must be delivered directly into his hands.</p>
<p>This matter is not subject to the consultation of anyone. That which has descended from the heaven of Will must be upheld, so that it may conform to the decisive command of God. The intention is that this matter not become widely known. The concealment of such matters has been, and still is, beloved in the sight of God.</p>
<p>He is the Concealer; He commands you to a majestic concealment. And He is the Patient; He commands you to a gracious patience. —End—</p>
<p>Regarding the promissory note you mentioned, and the decision not to proceed with it due to lack of wisdom: yes, tact must be exercised. Glory be to God! The world is witness and attests that the meaning in the divine Tablets is clear and manifest. Yet until now, the intention has not been understood.</p>
<p>This exalted phrase has been repeatedly heard from the Tongue of Grandeur:</p>
<p>“O servant present, this Manifestation has come for the reform of the world and the unity of the nations, so that, perhaps, by the Kawthar of expression—flowing at all times from the Pen of the All-Merciful—the concealed bitterness hidden in hearts may be cooled, and the form of the world cleansed from this black affliction, and healed.”</p>
<p>And at another time, this blessed word was heard from the sacred tongue:</p>
<p>“By the life of God, if harm were to come upon the essence of the True One, it would be more fitting and better than that falsehood should be spoken.”</p>
<p>Statements such as these have been heard many times from the Tongue of the All-Merciful. The very texts, scriptures, and Tablets bear testimony and clarification.</p>
<p>Blessed are the ones who perceive.</p>
<p>It is possible to rely on some justifications such that both the requester may be at ease and the intermediary assured.</p>
<p>This mortal servant asks and hopes from God—glorified be He—that the honored Master, Jináb S-Y, may be confirmed in that which is good and beneficial for all. If he is content with what was conveyed in the presence, then assuredly may God—glorified be His majesty—grant victory and bestow assistance. This victory and aid are not dependent upon outward means, nor have they ever been; rather, they are the supplication of this servant to the Lord, exalted be He, whose bounties are all-encompassing, and whose grace and generosity encircle all things.</p>
<p>As for meeting with those souls you mentioned: it is not permissible. The more one remains veiled from such persons, the better and more beloved it is.</p>
<p>Concerning Jináb Áqá ʻAlí Ḥaydar—upon him be the glory of God—you wrote that he is continually remembered in the Divine Presence. The reward of those who act has been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the Book. After presenting his mention before the Throne, this exalted word issued from the Tongue of the Lord of the worlds:</p>
<p>O Trustee, upon you be My glory. Jináb ʻAlí before Ḥaydar has attained the remembrance of God. God has ever aided him and granted him success in service to the Cause. What you wrote regarding him, his service, and the fire of divine love that burns within him is true. However, the ladder of ascent has many rungs, and the stations of recognition are without end.</p>
<p>We beseech God that each day He increase him and confirm him, so that he may attain to the station where all his deeds become as a single remembrance, and that the sincere may inhale from him the fragrance of the bounty of God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>The glory from Us be upon him and upon those whom the world has not beguiled, nor has it hindered them from drawing near to the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted<strong>.</strong> —End—</p>
<p>This lowly servant also sends him greetings, magnification, and praise. He is remembered in nights and days. Whoso is for God, God is for him. What is evident from him is the service of the divine Cause. The servant bears witness to what he sees. The Cause belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p>As for your mention of the beloved ones of God in Sísán—upon them be the glory of God—a Tablet, the Most Inaccessible and Most Sacred, was revealed especially for them and dispatched. Likewise, a Tablet for <em>Amat-Allah</em>, the daughter of Áqá Muḥammad Qulí, and a blessed Scroll for the sons of Khalíl—upon them be the glory of God—in the lands and the letter <em>M</em> were also revealed.</p>
<p>All that the beloved one wrote and requested was sent.</p>
<p>To the friends and lovers of God, in every land and city where they dwell, this servant sends to each of them greetings, exaltation, and magnification. The Lord is sought, and they are the seekers. They are the petitioners, and God is the One who answers.</p>
<p>Thus, we implore that He may enkindle His servants with the fire of love and illumine them with the light of knowledge. He is the One God, the Powerful over whatsoever He wills.</p>
<p>Perhaps, through the words of this mortal servant, they may be reminded and arise for that which benefits them.</p>
<p>Peace, praise, remembrance, glorification, and glory be upon your eminence, and upon them, and upon every steadfast, immovable, upright soul—every one who stands, who speaks forth, who explains, who knows.</p>
<p>And praise be to God, the Omnipotent, the Mighty, the Wise.<br>
– Written by the servant, in the exalted month of Shaʻbán, year 1304 [April/May 1887]</p>

<p>To the Beloved of the Heart, His Eminence the Trustee, upon him be the Glory of God, the Sovereign, the True, the Manifest—</p>
<p>In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Supreme, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise, remembrance, gratitude, and exaltation belong rightly and solely to the friends of the One Desired, who have clung to the cord of fidelity and taken hold of the hem of steadfastness. It has now become manifest what had previously descended from the heaven of Will:</p>
<p>“Thank Me, and I shall thank you.”</p>
<p>This is the gratitude for the fidelity, purity, assurance, and constancy of His chosen ones. Since what was incumbent upon them became evident, God—glorified be He—has revealed for them, in the scriptures and tablets, that which surpasses all comprehension and intellect.</p>
<p>Blessed and radiant are they!</p>
<p>O Beloved of My Heart—today this mortal servant has completed the responses to your letters. In the afternoon of this very day, the 14th of the exalted month of Sha‘bán, another letter of yours—numbered 3 and dated the 11th of Rajab—arrived. Praise be to God, the glad tidings of health and wellbeing are continual. This bounty is particular to hearing and sight, and it surpasses all outward blessings, for it is a mighty cause of human life.</p>
<p>Praise be to God in all conditions.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter from the Desired One of the World, His intention turned toward another place—namely, from Bahjí to Najíbíyyih. He directed His attention to this servant and to the group following in His footsteps. Upon arrival and after taking a cup of tea, as commanded, this servant set about responding to that blessed letter. I implore God—glorified be He—for assistance, that no neglect befall this reply.</p>
<p>After reading and becoming acquainted with its contents, the intention turned toward the most exalted summit. Turning the face toward His countenance, this servant presented himself, and these firm verses descended from the heaven of bounty:</p>
<p>The word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified, is this:<br>
“O Trustee, We have seen your letter and heard your call. We have answered you as a bounty from Us, for I am the Mighty, the Bestower. He is remembered by the One who remembers Him, and He confirms the one who turns toward Him and arises to serve the Cause with humility and penitence. Say: O people of Bahá! By God! Through detachment is the Cause of God uplifted among the servants. Blessed is the one adorned with this pearly garment—this is a command from God, the Cleaver of dawn.”</p>
<p>Now hear it in the Persian tongue:</p>
<p>“Give glad tidings to the people of Bahá through the remembrance of the Wronged One. We counsel all with that which leads to the elevation and exaltation of the Cause. Blessed is the one who remembers and teaches, adorned with the robe of severance.”</p>
<p>O Trustee! Praise be to God, you have not looked to outward means, nor do you rely upon them. This is a great bounty. Know its station.</p>
<p>Give greetings of glorification to the friends of that land. All are remembered.</p>
<p>What you wrote regarding ʻAlí Ḥaydar—upon him be My glory—blessed is he! He stands firm in service, looks toward the horizon, and remains upright in the Cause. He has continually been confirmed through the traces of the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a Tablet, radiant and revealed from the heaven of Will, was specifically sent for ‘Ayn and Bā’—upon them be My glory—with instructions that the aforementioned be its bearer. Likewise, a Tablet was revealed and sent for the Deputy—upon him be My glory.</p>
<p>God willing, they shall attain to it. Truly, he has been faithful to the Covenant of God, the Lord of all the worlds.<br>
The glory from Us be upon you, upon My friends there, and upon every firm and steadfast soul. —End—</p>
<p>That beloved has always been the recipient of special favors—praise be to God! You have inhaled the fragrances of the days, and you arose to serve. Wealth, adornment, livelihood, and comfort did not hinder that sanctified being from steadfastness, service, or the fear of God.</p>
<p>This is testified by what the servant has presented to our Lord and yours, our aim and yours, the aim of all in the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>What was written about the exaltation of the Cause and the sufficiency of God is true. All things affirm this truth.</p>
<p>As for your mention of the honored brother, Jináb Áqá ʻAlí Ḥaydar—upon him be the glory of God, and likewise their steadfastness in the Cause, their being ablaze with the fire of divine love, their turning toward the light of the Countenance, and their rising to serve the Cause—all have been mentioned in the Most Inaccessible, Most Sacred Court, and recorded by the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>Blessed is he!<br>
This mortal servant beseeches God to bestow upon him that which is worthy of His bounty and grace. Verily, our Lord, the All-Merciful, is powerful over whatsoever He wills. He says ‘Be,’ and it is.</p>
<p>You also wrote concerning Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Jawád, from among the people of Nūn and Rā—upon him be the glory of God—and his fidelity to the Covenant. You also mentioned Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Báqir—upon him be the glory—and his love and service.</p>
<p>After being presented in the sacred court, these radiant, luminous verses descended:</p>
<p>The Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified, is this:<br>
“O Muḥammad Báqir, you have attained to the bounty of the Bayan of the All-Merciful and the table sent down from the heaven of gnosis. In these days, the Trustee—upon him be My glory—has mentioned your turning, your love, and your steadfastness. Blessed are you both. We ask God to confirm you both in all conditions and to ordain for you that whose fragrance will never fade, through the eternity of the dominion and the kingdom.”</p>
<p>O Jawād, the Trustee—upon him be My glory—has presented your Covenant and your fidelity to it. God—glorified be He—is observing your affairs from the horizon of constancy and love. Other matters, if expressed with spirit and fragrance, are accepted in light of the manifest signs. Praise be to God! You have continually been mentioned, praised, and engaged in service. Blessed are you both. —End—</p>
<p>You also mentioned Jináb Áqá Mírzá Faẓlulláh—upon him be the glory of God—and his steadfastness and love. After being presented in the Most Inaccessible, Most Sacred Court, this exalted word shone forth from the heaven of the Will of the Possessor of Names:</p>
<p>The Word of the Lord, exalted and sanctified, is this:<br>
“O Faẓlulláh! We were with you. We heard and saw. Verily, your Lord is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. We witnessed what befell you. Nothing is hidden from the knowledge of your Lord. He is indeed the All-Perceiving, the Bestower, the Concealer, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Give thanks to your Lord for the sea of His bounty that surged, and for what He revealed to you that reminds you of what was sent down in His clear Book.”</p>
<p>We ask God to confirm you in all conditions. He is the Mighty, the Powerful. —End—</p>
<p>You also mentioned Jináb Áqá Mírzá Muḥammad—upon him be the glory of God—the son of the exalted and blessed soul, purified and radiant, Ḥā’ and Sīn, who ascended to the highest horizon. He, his brothers, and sisters are all mentioned in the sacred court. Their names were repeatedly honored after his ascension. All attained the bounty of the traces of the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>Some time ago, the gaze of the bounty of God—glorified be He—was turned toward them, and a Tablet, the Most Inaccessible and Most Sacred, was revealed and dispatched for each of them. But until now, no news has arrived about their receipt. Whoso is for God, God is for him. At the time of his ascension, and that of the honored leaf—upon them be the glory of God—there descended that which is the Euphrates of mercy and the Kawthar of bounty for them.</p>
<p>This servant also now sends them glorification and peace, and asks for that which has no equal. Verily, our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Hearer, the Responsive.</p>
<p>You also mentioned Jináb Áqá Mírzá Muḥammad ʻAlí—upon him be the glory of God—the son-in-law of the exalted one—upon him be the glory of God and mercy. You wrote of his attraction, rapture, steadfastness, and love for the Beloved, and of the love that the Beloved bore for him.</p>
<p>After presenting it in the Presence, these firm verses descended from the heaven of wisdom and exposition:</p>
<p>Blessed and exalted is His utterance, and glorified His mention:</p>
<p>In the name of the Hearer, the Responsive.<br>
O you who are remembered in the presence of the Wronged One— The letter from one who loved Me and loved My friends has arrived, and in it was your mention. We have remembered you in this clear Tablet. You had already attained to the traces of My Most Exalted Pen; this is a second time— Give thanks to your Lord, the Compassionate, the Generous. Blessed is the one who has turned and attained,<br>
While most of the servants have turned away from God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>We have adorned the heaven of gnosis with stars of proof, And We have sent down from the Kingdom of the Bayan that which no learned scholar nor insightful knower can reckon. If you drink the wine of revelation from My Most Exalted Pen, Then say:</p>
<p>O my God, O my God, Praise be to You for confirming me, and teaching me, and acquainting me with that which most of Your creation were denied. I ask You, by the rains of the clouds of Your bounty and the lights of the sun of Your Manifestation, To make me steadfast in Your Cause and gazing toward Your horizon. Then I ask You, O God of existence, Master of the unseen and the seen, To ordain for me, from the wonders of Your bounty, what You have decreed for Your friends. Verily, You are powerful over all that You will. There is no god but You, the Forgiving, the Generous.” —End—</p>
<p>This servant also sends him glorification and peace.</p>
<p>In truth, that beloved wrote of these honored ones in such a way that it stirred the heart anew and brought about wondrous illumination. Though they had always been remembered, this time the matter appeared anew and a fresh light of love radiated.</p>
<p>We ask God to aid and bless him with that which is worthy of His grace.</p>
<p>O beloved of My heart! Today the gaze of God is turned with favor upon the righteous deeds of existence, and is drawn to a single word spoken in sincerity. In the sight of God, it is as a recorded book. And a drop of sincere deeds is reckoned as a sea, and this is specific to this Most Great Manifestation—glorified be His majesty and all-encompassing His grace.</p>
<p>You wrote of the honored and beloved one, Jináb Ḥájí Mírzá ’A-B—upon him be the glory of God—and his being inflamed with the fire of divine love. The matter is just as your eminence wrote: praise be to God, he has entered and is kindled like a globe of fire in the love of God. Signs of steadfastness and the blaze of the divine flame have appeared from him on several occasions in the presence.</p>
<p>The servant prays to his Lord that He may strengthen him in remembrance and praise, and grant him success in serving His determined and manifest Cause.</p>
<p>You also mentioned the two brothers of Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar—upon him and upon them be the glory of God—and wrote of their love, turning, humility, and submission in the path of God. This note opened the gate of joy. Praise be to God, they are confirmed by divine bounty and are mentioned in the presence of God. Even before, their names were recorded by the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>The servant asks his Lord that He may strengthen and confirm them and ordain for them that which brings them nearer to God, the Lord of the mighty Throne.</p>
<p>You mentioned Jináb Áqá Mírzá Faẓlulláh—upon him be the glory of God. Praise be to God, in the upheavals of this land he has clung to the cord of sincerity and fidelity. His mention and his love have continually been present even in the Most Great Prison. God willing, he will attain to that which the changes of the world and the upheavals of nations cannot affect. Verily, our Lord is the Witness, the All-Knowing, the Helper, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! The workings of divine bounty have had—and continue to have—limitless manifestations upon the earth.</p>
<p>The honored and beloved one, Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar—upon him be the glory of God—turned with eagerness and attained. Through the grace of the Name the Self-Subsisting, he drank from the sealed wine and arose to serve the Cause.</p>
<p>The effulgences of divine grace and infinite mercy have encompassed him from all directions. Among these is the letter of that beloved, in whose beginning, middle, and end his name was mentioned—his steadfastness, his flame of love, his service, his devotion, and also his rising up in outward and inward matters.</p>
<p>Upon presenting these lines at the most exalted summit, before the Countenance of the Lord of all being, there descended that which this mortal servant is incapable of recounting. The sea of bounty surged in such waves that those of insight and intellect are powerless to grasp them.</p>
<p>Blessed and honored is he.</p>
<p>In this moment, fresh showers of divine love poured forth. The letter of the beloved of the heart—marked as the fourth, dated the twenty-fourth of the month of Rajab—arrived. Its arrival was like a spiritual herald, for it brought news of health, well-being, and standing firm in service to the Desired One. Truly, with eloquent expression, it recited the name of the Desired One. Well is it with the people of Bahá who have drunk the cup of faithfulness from the hands of bounty.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning the friends of the True One—their steadfastness, their love, their compassion, their unity and harmony—after its presentation in the Most Inaccessible, Most Sacred Court, it was honored with acceptance.</p>
<p>In that moment, the Tongue of Grandeur uttered this exalted blessed word:</p>
<p>O servant present, give glad tidings to the Trustee of the bounty of God, the Lord of all the worlds. Say: O Trustee, the Wronged One has heard your call and seen your condition. He is indeed the All-Hearing and the All-Seeing. Blessed are you, O Trustee, for adorning your form with the armor of humility, your body with the garment of meekness, and your head with the crown of detachment.</p>
<p>If the friends were to taste the sweetness of this station, the world would not remain deprived of this supreme bounty. Humility, meekness, and other commendable qualities and pure deeds are under the command of the Supreme Commander among the hosts of God. And the Supreme Commander has always been, and remains, the fear of God. —End—</p>
<p>We had often heard of sugar, but that was only words. In truth, spiritual sweetness and true delight have always been the repeated utterances of the friends of God. Sugar, when repeated or used many times, dulls desire and weakens appetite. But the words of the saints of God, the more they are repeated, the more delightful and beloved they become.</p>
<p>I ask and hope from God—glorified be He—to assist this servant in presenting this reply. He is the Able, the Powerful.</p>
<p>Praise be to God—again and again, and again and again, until it reaches the fifth time—the fifth letter, dated the first of the exalted month of Sha‘bán, arrived.</p>
<p>It was kohl for the eye and a balanced elixir for the heart, for it was adorned with mention of the Desired One and illumined with the light of His love.</p>
<p>You wrote concerning the honored brother and noble friend, the Deputy—upon him be the glory of God, the Master of the Footstool—and also about his longing, yearning, love, affection, and his being ablaze with the fire of the Rahmánic Lote Tree and the Tree planted on the Mount of Eternity. All of it was presented in the Most Inaccessible, Most Sacred Court.</p>
<p>On the night of the third of the blessed month of Ramaḍán, two hours past sunset, he attained to the honor of presence and was graced with the attention of the Beloved of the world.</p>
<p>The word of God, blessed and exalted, was uttered:</p>
<p>O Trustee, upon you be the glory of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. The servant is present before the face of the Wronged One. And as for what you wrote concerning the friends of God and the people you presented concerning the divine friends was heard. Jináb Ná ’Alí Qabl Akbar—upon him be Bahá—has, in his few years, risen with utmost resolve to serve, as though he has inhaled the scent of detachment and attained it in the days of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy. With full love and turning, he has turned to the Supreme Horizon and directed his face toward the countenance. Blessed is he—his reward is with your Lord.</p>
<p>By My life, it has been recorded by My Most Exalted Pen in the Crimson Tablet: “Verily, your Lord is the True and the Trustworthy.” We have accepted what he has done in the path of God and what he has desired in these days, as a bounty from Us unto him. And I am the Bestower, the Generous. Let him be assured in the grace and bounty of God, holding fast to the wisdom that We revealed in various Tablets. Verily, your Lord is the Compassionate, the Clarifier, the Wise.</p>
<p>He is under the gaze of My bounty, and We have sheltered him under the canopy of My grace, which has encompassed those in the heavens and on earth. O Trustee, blessed are you and he! He has attained to that which no thing among created things can equal. Give him glad tidings of My mention, My mercy, and My bounty. Let him give thanks to his Lord by night and by day, at every dawn and every eve.</p>
<p>Those souls who have given up themselves and what they possess in the path of the One Beloved—they are confirmed by special divine favors. The whole world cannot equal what has been decreed for them. But the matter of such souls should remain concealed. Verily, your Lord speaks the truth and inspires whom He wills with what He desires, and guides the seekers to His straight path. —End—</p>
<p>This mortal servant asks and hopes from God, glorified be He, that He may cause him to shine forth from the horizon of the heaven of the Great Will as a sun of detachment. After presenting mention of him and his deeds in the sacred court, what was revealed from the heaven of the Will is such that this servant is powerless and incapable of describing it. What remains in memory has been conveyed. In truth, he has reached a station in service that transcends description.</p>
<p>O beloved of My heart! In days when those on earth are deprived of the sealed wine and turned away from the hidden mystery and the concealed unseen, if a soul like him rises to action, it testifies to his devotion, attention, and service.</p>
<p>In truth, this is one of the special bounties of God that has been bestowed upon him. O Lord, increase him in all conditions and confirm him in that which uplifts Your Cause. Then illumine him with the lights of Your bounty and grace, such that the faces of Your servants and the hearts of Your creation may shine by him. Verily, You are the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>Some time ago, concerning the aforementioned matter, it was written to the honored beloved Jináb Áqá Mírzá Asadu’lláh—upon him be the most glorious Bahá. After presenting the matter in the sacred court, what was determined for a single city was accepted, and the rest was granted to him after it too was accepted.</p>
<p>A Tablet was revealed from the heaven of the Will, and written in this servant’s hand, it was sent. Now that he has risen anew to this matter, and the beloved has again requested acceptance, therefore, what has been granted to you is accepted and has attained confirmation through the Pen of the Most High. Blessed is he and praised. As for the remainder, act with moderation in accordance with the command. The blessed Tablet revealed on this matter and previously sent has, God willing, arrived. You may review it.</p>
<p>The letter of the honored brother, Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar—upon him be Bahá—and his mercy, compassion, and gaze of favor toward the friends has always been present. These are the friends who find neither life nor death for themselves, neither harm nor benefit, save by His command, His permission, His bounty, and His grace. The description of such souls has existed in previous and subsequent books. The Sidrat al-Muntahá has testified and continues to testify. All things bear witness. Blessed are the hearers.</p>
<p>You also wrote that the aforementioned intends to dedicate what he possesses to the Right of God. After presenting this, it was said:</p>
<p>This is already fulfilled, for what he possesses is already God’s, and We have entrusted it to Him. For he is, night and day, occupied with serving God, glorified be He, and His friends. Whenever the desire for disposal arises, We shall give the command and take action.</p>
<p>His service in the sight of God and his friendship with you and the friends is greater than the payment of the Huqúq. This specific matter concerning him has been revealed from the Names of Grace. And even what he contributes is accepted due to the all-encompassing bounty of God. Otherwise, his very service suffices.</p>
<p>Since the benefit of the Huqúq returns to the tranquil and content souls, its receipt from the heaven of bounty, in consideration of the conditions, was permitted. He testifies to His sufficiency from the heavens and on earth—these matters and those like them—whatever has appeared from that beloved is adorned with the lights of the sun of acceptance.</p>
<p>Bahá, and remembrance and praise be upon your eminence and upon those who love you and listen to your words in the Cause of God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>Servant, 5th of Ramaḍán 1304.</p>
<p>He is God</p>
<p>O beloved of My heart,</p>
<p>The sending of the letter was delayed until the seventh missive, dated the 16th of Sha‘bán, arrived—bringing renewed joy. Praise be to God, that beloved is confirmed through the bounty of God and is diligent in sending communications, and attentive to new information and the fresh events that reach from the friends. This, in one respect, is counted as a great blessing. We ask God to increase it through His grace and generosity.</p>
<p>Regarding your note on the love and unity with the honored one, Jináb-i-Asm J-M—upon him the Glory of God, the All-Glorious—you also recorded his steadfastness and his blazing fire in the Cause of God.<br>
Complete joy was obtained from this passage.</p>
<p>After it was presented in the Most Sacred and Most Exalted Presence, the Tongue of Grandeur, the Lord of the Worlds, spoke with this exalted word:</p>
<p>O present servant, ask of God for those souls who have attained the adornment of divine distinction, that in all circumstances they may keep their gaze fixed upon that which will raise up the Cause of God.</p>
<p>Asm-i-Jamál—upon him be Bahá—has always been remembered in the sacred presence. We ask God to confirm him and to grant him success, that with all determination he may rise up for unity. Indeed, We remember him at this moment and We direct him with what is befitting for this wondrous, glorious day.<br>
—End—</p>
<p>This servant is always asking for him that which will lead to the exaltation of the Word of God in all aspects.</p>
<p>You then mentioned the spiritual beloved, Jináb Áqá Mírzá Ghulám-’Alí, son of Ḥaḍrat Zabíḥ—upon them both be Bahá—and his confirmations; as well as the spiritual beloved, Jináb Áqá Mírzá Mu’min and the handmaid from his household—upon them both be Bahá.</p>
<p>After being presented in the Most Sacred Presence, each of them was honored by the exaltation of the Most High Pen. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur spoke at that moment:</p>
<p>O Master of the Footstool and the One Manifest through the Most Great Name! You hear the call of Your lovers and their cries in separation from You. You see them, O my God, turning toward Your Horizon and holding fast to Your Cord.</p>
<p>I ask You, O Lord of the world and Sovereign of the nations, that You decree for them from Your Most High Pen the good of this world and the next. Then record for them the reward of the near ones. Indeed, You are the God of the worlds and the Desire of the knowers. —End—</p>
<p>Praise be to God, each has attained the ocean of the Bayan of the All-Merciful. Blessed is their joy.</p>
<p>And this servant, in response to the letter of the spiritual beloved Jináb Áqá Mírzá Ghulám-’Alí—upon him be Bahá—has written what, God willing, had already been conveyed before. He asks forgiveness for the delay. He has never been forgotten and never will be.</p>
<p>I convey my greeting and reverent praise to him and to Jináb Áqá Mírzá Mu’min and the handmaid, and I have mentioned and continue to mention each of them in the sacred court.</p>
<p>As for your mention of Mírzá-yi-W-S-Kh-A, upon him be Bahá—you wrote that he is confirmed by divine grace and illumined by the light of faith. This lowly servant sends him greetings and praise and prays to God, exalted be He, to grant him success. Truly, He is the Generous Bestower.</p>
<p>You then mentioned the honored, exalted, beloved, Jináb ’Alí Qabl Akbar—upon him be Bahá, Possessor of Glory—and noted that he teaches without veil or concealment, yet without departing from wisdom, for he is active within his own home. At the beginning of his teaching efforts, he said before the son of the Shah: “I have confessed this word, and I have been imprisoned several times. We are not corrupt people—we have a religion, and we do not abandon our faith for the comfort of this world.”</p>
<p>After this statement was presented in the Sacred Court, it was said:<br>
“Write: Jináb Amín—upon him be Bahá—is the same as his Lord. For We too have confessed, and have been imprisoned several times.”</p>
<p>It was also commanded:<br>
“Give him two man of Tabríz tea and ten man of Tabríz sugar.” This is a blessing for him, and even its effect has been confirmed. Truly, He is the Compassionate, the Generous.—End—</p>
<p>Indeed, he is sincere, steadfast, and upright in all that he has declared. I ask God to cause to flow from him the rivers of wisdom and exposition, that he may attract the people of the world. Verily, our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the Mighty, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>I send him greetings and praise. A reply to his letter is being sent. In all matters, I beseech God for his confirmation and success. May He assist this lowly servant in sending responses.</p>
<p>The petition of Jináb Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Ḥasan—may God sanctify him—was received and attained the honor of being heard by the Lord of the Names. Praise be to God, his letter was adorned with the ornament of divine unity, and with turning, humility, lowliness, and steadfastness.</p>
<p>This servant gives him glad tidings that what he offered in his letter was accepted in the Most Sacred and Exalted Presence. Blessed is he! God willing, a response will be granted.</p>
<p>As for the matters he raised regarding inheritance: whatever was done in the beginning was carried out with wisdom and signed. But thereafter, it remains subject to the divine command.</p>
<p>Bahá, remembrance, and praise be upon you, and upon him, and upon all who are steadfast and upright.</p>

<p>To the honored and beloved Jináb Amín—upon him be God’s peace and confirmations—please consider:</p>
<p>He is God, exalted is His glory, majesty, and power.</p>
<p>Praise is due to the Desired One who showed the straight path and sent a guide, who placed a treasure in every station and announced it. The true treasures have ever been and remain the friends of God. They are the repositories of the mysteries of the Prophets and the pearls of the knowledge of the purified ones.</p>
<p>The path ends at the straight way and the great news of the Prophets. He sealed prophethood and apostleship with Him, and promised the appearance of the Resurrection and the Hour, and the manifestation of His power on that Day—exalted is His might, His sovereignty, His majesty, and His grandeur.</p>
<p>Blessings and peace be upon the one whom He made the dawning-place of His Names, the rising-place of His attributes, the treasury of His knowledge, the source of His command—and upon his family and companions, through whom the Cause of God encompassed the east and the west of the earth, and that which had been written in the Books and their verses became manifest.</p>
<p>This servant beseeches his Lord, through them and their power, might, deeds, sincerity, humility, and lowliness, that He may confirm Islam just as He supported it at first, so that the entire religion may appear, even though the idolaters may detest it.</p>
<p>And now, O beloved of My heart! Although each of your letters is like a volume reflecting the sorrows endured in separation, God is witness and aware that this servant, too, has been deeply saddened and grieved by separation from the friends. However, since great reward has been destined for beautiful patience, we must hold fast to it and cling to it.</p>
<p>Beyond this, since the intention of that beloved in all matters has been service, as is evident in his words and deeds, he should be adorned in all conditions with the ornament of joy. I beseech and hope from God, exalted be He, that He may grant confirmations so that he may attain that which is acceptable and mentioned before God.</p>
<p>At the time when mention of your presence and services issued from the heart and tongue, and a letter from Jináb-i-Ná’ib and Jináb-i-Áqá ’Alí-Ḥaydar—upon them be Bahá and His confirmations—was received in the name of that beloved, after it was presented in the sacred presence, the Blessed Beauty said:</p>
<p>The friends should look to what is good and praiseworthy. It is not appropriate to criticize a soul who is commanded to serve. Jináb ’Alí-Ḥaydar is, in truth, engaged in service. All should be content, not complain.</p>
<p>Glory be to God! Until now, people have not yet fully understood what is truly appropriate. Acceptance and rejection are the exclusive domain of God, exalted be He. Whatever has been revealed in the divine Book must be observed and accepted. Blessed is the soul whose will is merged with the Will of God, and whose desire is annihilated in His Desire.</p>
<p>O Amín, write to Jináb-i-Ná’ib and ’Alí-Ḥaydar—upon them be peace—to cling to what is good and to be detached from the world. Praise be to God, they are confirmed in turning and engaged in service. We ask God, the Exalted, that He may ordain for them that which endures in the kingdom with the permanence of the spiritual dominion. He is powerful over all things and may grant them success in what befits His days.</p>
<p>They have always been and continue to be remembered. In every condition, I ask on their behalf for that which shall not be lost. We also ask God to grant them the good of this world and the next. Indeed, He is the Bountiful, the Generous. We counsel everyone to act with wisdom and with that which will uplift the station of humanity. Indeed, He is the Almighty, the Bestower. —End—</p>
<p>This lowly servant also sends them greetings and praise and prays for their success.</p>
<p>The letter addressed to that beloved was sent. Another letter was received from Jináb-i-Ḥájí Muḥammad-’Alí M-Y—peace of God be upon him—written in the name of that beloved. After it was presented in the presence, it was said:</p>
<p>O Amín, you have often mentioned him and other friends. You have affirmed their right upon all by this remembrance. From the wronged One, write to him:</p>
<p>‘Praise be to God, you are clinging to that which is good, and you are steadfast in it. You were mentioned before the wronged One. I ask God, exalted be He, that His confirmations never be withheld from you at any time, and that His mercy never be cut off. He is powerful and able.’</p>
<p>O Amín, what you wrote is accepted and true. Give him glad tidings, and those with him, of the mention of the wronged One. We have mentioned him again and again that he may rejoice and be among the victorious.—End—</p>
<p>His letter was also sent. Please review it.</p>
<p>This servant also sends greetings and praise to him and all the others. In every condition, I beseech God, exalted be He, for success and confirmation for all. Indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the Responsive.</p>
<p>As for what was written about the matter of the trust (amānat), God willing, it will reach that beloved. Let there be assurance about this matter.</p>
<p>The beloved of the heart, Jináb Ibn-i-Aṣdaq—peace and confirmations of God be upon him—sent a letter. However, since that beloved stated that he is in Batumi and from there, he is turning his attention in that direction, and so the reply to his letter was not sent to ’Alyyih. I ask for confirmation from the True Supporter and spiritual Helper that his reply may also be sent.</p>
<p>His mention and that of the spiritual beloved Jináb Áqá Ghulám-Ḥusayn—upon him be peace of God—has been and remains constant.</p>
<p>To the honored beloved Nabíl son of Nabíl, and his son who was present and attained, and the son of the honored beloved Ḥaḍrat S. M.—upon them be peace and confirmations and grace—I offer greetings and praise. I ask the Almighty Lord for enduring blessings, lasting bounty, and pure living for them all. Likewise, I send greetings to the friends of that land and to the honored beloved Jináb Áqá Muḥammad-’Alí—upon him be peace of God. He has always been remembered in my heart.</p>
<p>O beloved of my heart, the heedlessness and pride of the people of the world have deprived them of what would benefit them. In former days, the majesty of Islám and its might shook the kings of the world and filled them with fear. But now, matters have reached a point where every polytheist rises to commit injustice and has brought about whatever he desired.</p>
<p>Today, the people of unity must, all together, cling to the cord of divine grace and seek from God and plead with Him—perhaps He will change this weakness into strength and this helplessness into power. If we do not rise to make amends for what is past, new losses will continue to overtake us at every moment. The sleep of heedlessness has overtaken all, and the intoxication of self-desire has deprived everyone—except for those whom God wills.</p>
<p>This servant, that honored one, and all others must beseech the True and Mighty One: first, that He may grant us the success to purify ourselves with the water of repentance; and second, that He may adorn us with the ornament of trustworthiness, faithfulness, chastity, truthfulness, purity, sanctity, and loyalty. We must ask Him for that which will raise and exalt the cause of the people of unity, their loftiness, honor, and strength.</p>
<p>God is witness and aware that what has been said is for His sake, and the intent is the elevation of the Word of Unity. But the heedless ones have attributed it to corruption and have inflicted such harm that tongue and pen are both powerless to describe it. Nevertheless, I supplicate and hope from God, exalted be His station, that He may not deprive His servants of the garment of justice and fairness. He is the Hearer, and He is the Answerer.</p>
<p>I bear witness that there is no God but Him—acknowledging His oneness and confessing His singularity—that He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden, and He is the Hearer, the Answerer. He is the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Peace be upon you, and upon those with you, and upon the righteous servants of God. And praise belongs to God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>The servant<br>
23rd of the month of Ṣafar, year 1304</p>

<p>In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</p>
<p>Praise be to God, who has guided us to the most elevated Horizon and given us to drink from the sweetest Kawthar of His utterance, and granted us the encounter and nearness to Him. He has honored us with presence before the court of His Throne, and permitted us, through His bounty and grace, to mention and praise Him. We thank Him, we glorify Him, and we ask His forgiveness in all states—indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted.</p>
<p>As for the letter of that honored beloved, dated the eleventh of Muharram, it has arrived and attained the honor of being presented before and heard by the Lord of the world. By the life of the One who is our aim, your aim, and the aim of those in the heavens and on earth: the grace, gifts, and bounties that have descended from the heaven of generosity upon the station of verses can be compared to nothing. Intellect and understanding themselves confess their inability to enumerate them. If it were said they are like raindrops or as numerous as the sand particles of all the worlds, it would still fall short.</p>
<p>It is thus clearly and evidently proven that there is no likeness or equal to His bounties. Exalted is His grace! Magnified is His bounty! Mighty is His sovereignty! Lofty is His utterance!</p>
<p>After becoming aware, He turned toward the requested place and addressed the following in response—He, exalted and blessed, said:</p>
<p>“We have mentioned you and sent down to you from the heaven of bounty the Kawthar of the Divine Utterance—no oceans of the world, no books of the nations, can be compared to even a single drop from it. Give thanks and say: ‘All praise is Yours, O Desire of the Worlds!’ O Amín, you have been mentioned in most gatherings and your name has flowed from the tongue of the Wronged One. Praise be to God! You attained the honor of service and have been liberated from unworthy constraints. The Most Exalted Pen has ever testified to your service, love, and sincerity concerning that which Ḥaydar Qabl ’Alí—upon him be My glory—had requested. The right was yours, though you did not possess it, and it was not fitting in the eyes of religion that you should remain without it. Your being is enriched in its poverty and submissive in its independence, for your affair returns to the True One. We ask from Him that you may ever be illumined by the lights of the radiant sun of sufficiency and detachment.”</p>
<p>Every soul, in perfect humility and reverence and with fragrance and delight, should pay the Rights of God—receive them! Otherwise, your Lord is indeed the Self-Sufficient, the Exalted. Behold what the All-Merciful has revealed in the Criterion:</p>
<p>“O people, you are the poor in relation to God, and God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy.”</p>
<p>Remaining in the land of Ṭá is not greatly advisable—so make your days therein like the days of a flower in a garden.</p>
<p>The permission for turning to the desired direction has already been given. So turn your face toward God, the All-Possessing, the Ever-Living. Turn with such turning that all beings are turned toward God, the Sender of the verses and the Manifestation of clear proofs.</p>
<p>Convey glorification to the friends of that land. Say:</p>
<p>“O party of God, restrain your loud braying and open neighing! Preserve yourselves in the name of the Truth—glorious is His majesty!”</p>
<p>The sneaky whisperer of the world is engaged in insinuations. Exert yourselves that the delusions of the past may not return, and that the helpless servants not fall into the well of suspicion.</p>
<p>For 1,200 years, they said, “O Imám!” and “O Trustee!”—yet in the end, they martyred one by whose Word a thousand Imáms would have been created! Woe to them, to their deeds, and to their actions! They committed what neither the Jews nor any party among the sects committed.</p>
<p>The honored ones of the land of K have entered in perfect health and well-being, and after circumambulating the Ka‘bah, they attained to circumambulating the Hidden Mystery. Joy to them, and radiant good tidings upon them. In the gatherings of the Imám of faces, the Tongue of Grandeur repeatedly mentioned that beloved one, and each attained what has been recorded and inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the divine Books. This lowly servant prays for every one of them to be granted success and confirmation in preserving what has been bestowed—indeed, our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the One who confirms, assists, forgives, and is most generous.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Jináb N—upon him be the glory of God and His grace—praise be to God, he has been and remains successful. It is hoped that from him will appear that which is recorded in the divine Book and will remain eternal—especially during this moment when I was present in the Most Holy Court. His mention flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. By the life of our ultimate purpose, nothing compares to the mention of Him, neither the mention of the world nor what its people possess.</p>
<p>Blessed are the souls who, on this wondrous Day, have been adorned with the embroidery of divine favor and have drunk from the ocean of meanings. They have indeed attained every good. Blessed are they and those who have succeeded through their deeds, their love, and their loyalty! His is the bounty and the grace in all conditions—indeed, He is the One who speaks the Command at the beginning and at the end.</p>
<p>From this lowly servant, convey glorification, praise, remembrance, and greetings to him and to all the friends of God. For each one, I request from the True One—glorious is His majesty—that which He has promised and revealed in His Book. Indeed, He is the One who fulfills His promise, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote concerning Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar—upon him be the glory of God—praise be to God, he has attained the radiance of the Sun of Truth and drunk from the ocean of Divine Knowledge—glorious is His majesty. It is hoped he will become a source of all-embracing services, a cause for the enkindlement of souls, and a perpetual remembrance in the dominions of earth and heaven.</p>
<p>That beloved one spoke of his being set ablaze with the fire of divine love and his rise in service to the Cause, and this is indeed the truth, without doubt.</p>
<p>Regarding the honored and beloved Jináb Áqá Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl—upon him be the glory of God and His favors—and also the stipend for Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar—upon him be the glory of God—the matter was presented before the presence of the Possessor of Power and attained the honor of being heard. His blessed and exalted words were:</p>
<p>“Those who spend their wealth in the path of God—these are among the people of the highest paradise. The hosts of the Supreme Concourse and the most exalted heaven send blessings upon them. Indeed, bounty is in His hand; He does what He wills by His command. He is the Ordainer, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jináb Muḥammad-’Alí Khán—upon him be the glory of God—and the brother of Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar, Jináb Aḥad Áqá—upon them both be the glory of God—praise be to God, both are mentioned before the Throne and have attained the favors of the True One—glorious is His majesty. They have drunk from the pure wine of Revelation and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon. This is from His grace upon them—indeed, our Lord, the All-Merciful, is the most bountiful and generous.</p>
<p>This servant sends glorification and greetings to their honored brother Khán—upon him be the glory of God—and to the aforementioned brother, and I ask God that in these days, I may be enabled to send a reply to the letter of the honored Khán. At all times, the enkindled souls who are content and well-pleased should pray for each other and beseech the True One to confirm all upon that which is worthy and befitting of this Day.</p>
<p>And concerning Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Riḍá, I ask and hope from God that He may confirm him in remembrance, praise, and service, and strengthen him to manifest in the world of existence that station by which the true rank of humanity becomes known and apparent. This is what the Tongue of God has spoken before and after.</p>
<p>For indeed, the Tongue of Grandeur has ever spoken this blessed Word:</p>
<p>“O servant, ask from God that He may confirm your friends so that through them the station of humanity may appear and become manifest in the world of existence.”</p>
<p>As for the mention of the lands of K and Q and M, and the brothers Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Ḥusayn and Mashhadí Muḥammad Riḍá—upon them both be the glory of God—they are among those souls who have attained the station of contentment through the good pleasure of the Lord of Names. Convey greetings and glorification from this lowly servant to them.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Áqá Qásim, another brother of Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar, it was presented at a special moment before the Presence of the True One—glorious is His majesty—and the Tongue of Grandeur responded with these words:</p>
<p>“O Amín, the Most Exalted Pen testifies that that noble one is engaged and remains engaged in the remembrance of the friends of God. In every letter you have written to this servant, you have mentioned the friends and loved ones. May God grant you the reward and enable you to attain the meeting again so that you may hear what I have heard and see what I have seen.”</p>
<p>And as for what was mentioned about Qásim, let him read what has now been revealed by the Most Exalted Pen:</p>
<p>“O Qásim, the Wronged One remembers you for the sake of God and says: If you desire to remember God, the Lord of the Throne and the dust, the Master of the Hereafter and the First Life, rise from your place, then turn your face toward the House of God, the Sacred House, and say: ’O my God, O my God! All praise is Yours for the fragrance of Your knowledge that has spread, for the Sun of Baṭḥá has risen from the horizon of Ḥijáz, and the banners of Your victory have been raised among the people. I ask You—O You in Whose grasp are the reins of the earth and the heavens, by Whose command the Kingdom of Names has appeared in the world of creation—that You may strengthen me and Your servants to turn toward Your highest horizon and Your most glorious sanctuary. O my God, O my God! I am the one who confesses and acknowledges my poverty and by Your sufficiency that has encompassed all horizons, and by my powerlessness and Your might, which overwhelmed the strength of the strongest and the authority of the rulers, I ask You, do not deprive me of what You have decreed through Your Most Exalted Pen for Your pure servants—those who were never turned away from turning toward You and rising for Your service by the illusions arising from the dawning-places of vain imaginings.</p>
<p>O Lord, grant me that which will remove choice from my hands and cause the breezes of Your will to move me however You will. Indeed, You are the All-Powerful over what You will. Then, make me, O my God, detached unto You, immersed in the ocean of Your mercy and forgiveness, clinging to the rope of Your generosity, and grasping the hem of Your grace. Will You, O my God, repel a poor one who has hastened toward You, or reject a beggar who has confessed his helplessness before the manifestations of Your bounty and the outpourings of Your mercy? No, by Your very Self, for I am assured of Your power, authority, grace, mercy, generosity, and absolute will! There is no God but You, the Forgiving, the Merciful; there is no God but You, the Compassionate, the Generous.”</p>
<p>This supplication itself exerts influence upon the world, for it has flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur. Blessed is the one who recites it and attains its effects, God willing. May Jináb Qásim become the breaker of the spear of self and passion and attain with full spirit and fragrance the bounty of reciting it. The servant asks his Lord to confirm and assist him in reciting what has been revealed for him. Further, according to the command, that beloved one should not remain long in the land of Ṭá.</p>
<p>In the second letter, the mention was again made of the honored brothers—upon them be the glory of the All-Merciful—and also of the sum presented to the honored and exalted Lady, Umm Ḥaram—upon her be the glory of God. Their enkindlement with the fire of the love of God, their humility and reverence, and their services for the sake of God were all mentioned. All these matters attained the honor of being heard in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted, Most Holy Court before the Possessor of the Names. Each has been illumined by the lights of the Sun of Divine Grace. Blessed are they, and joy and gladness be upon them! May they ever be confirmed in service and adorned with divine bounty. I ask God, exalted be He, to send upon them blessings from His presence, uninterrupted by the rains of the clouds of His grace and the lights of the sun of His mercy. Indeed, He is the One who answers the call of those who ask.</p>
<p>Some of the requested tablets have been sent previously; this time as well, they are being sent, God willing, they will arrive and be delivered.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jináb Sayyid Farajulláh—upon him be the glory of God—and his companionship with that noble one, praise be to God, he succeeded in turning toward God, engaging in remembrance, praise, love, and affection for the friends of God. His letters have been repeatedly received, both by this servant and by His Holiness Asmá’—upon him be the most splendid glory—and all have been presented before the Possessor of Power and received the lights of the Utterance of the Beloved of all worlds. God willing, his reply will also be sent.</p>
<p>In these days, by the indication of that noble one, gatherings for tea were held in the sacred precincts of the presence of the Beloved of the Worlds, on behalf of the honored ladies, the two daughters of his paternal aunt—upon them be the glory of God—and the friends of God—upon them be the glory of God. This was written so that all may know that what has been received is also being conveyed.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Beyk, Áqá Muḥammad Ḥusayn Beyk, Áqá Ghulám Ḥusayn Beyk, and Áqá Turáb Beyk—upon them all be the glory of God—they attained the honor of being heard in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted Court. His blessed and exalted words were:</p>
<p>“O friends of the All-Merciful, praise be to God! By the influence of the Most Exalted Pen, you have attained the station of remembrance. Your mention has been recorded by the Wronged One and inscribed in the Tablets. Know your station and preserve it in the name of God—glorious is His majesty! For the people of the Bayán cling to the vain thoughts and delusions of the past and strive in the misguidance of the people. Glorified is God! Have they not seen the outcomes of the deeds of the Shí‘ah party and yet failed to understand, and now they have again clung to the paths of those sects!</p>
<p>O party of God in the lands! With the fingers of power, tear through all veils, that you may attain the lights of the true oneness of God. Today is the Day of God—nothing should be mentioned or seen but Him! Take what has been bestowed upon you from the Lord of all the worlds. Strengthen your resolve so that turbans, staffs, and cloaks do not again become the cause of illusions, nor plunge the helpless people into the well of vain imaginings and suspicions.”</p>
<p>This lowly servant sends glorification and greetings to each one and asks for steadfastness on behalf of all, that they may regard all besides God as perished and non-existent and count the doubts of atheists and the insinuations of the heedless as nothingness.</p>
<p>At this moment, turning my face toward the present one, His blessed and exalted words flowed:</p>
<p>“O servant present, write: O Amín! O Abu’l-Ḥasan! The Radiant Light of Baṭḥá and the Master of the Prophets—may the spirit of all else be a sacrifice for Him—has been sent from God to all who are upon the earth. The various sects each speak in their own tongues, and the differences of languages in the world are clear and evident. All are aware of this. God—glorious is His majesty—revealed the Criterion (the Qur’an), which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, in the pure Arabic language, and it was a proof upon Arabs and non-Arabs, Turks, and the various sects of the world. This language is powerful and comprehensive; thus, from the Most Exalted Pen, in most cases, this language flows and is revealed, though sometimes and at times in the Persian tongue, which is sweeter, yet confined within limitations. But He does whatsoever He wills and decrees whatsoever He desires, for He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful.</p>
<p>O Amín, the people of the Qur’an boasted to the world through the proof of the Qur’an, and the people of every religion gloried in their own Book. And the people of the Bayán clung to what was with them. In this Most Great Manifestation, from the very first day until now, day and night, verses have descended and luminous signs have appeared—equivalent to the books revealed before and after. What exists now, and what shall appear later, had already been fully and explicitly revealed by the Most Exalted Pen. Yet, despite this, they remain occupied with their vain imaginings, and are prevented and deprived from the effulgences of the light of the Sun of Certainty.</p>
<p>What has happened to their eyes that they do not see, and to their ears that they do not hear? They play with their desires, but they do not perceive. By what proof do those souls who deny this Cause seek to establish another? By the life of God, the Point of the Bayán weeps! The entire Bayán is like a ring upon the finger of the power of the Almighty. He turns it however He wills and moves it as He desires.</p>
<p>May the True One, the Radiant Light, grant justice and equity through His overpowering power from behind the clouds, so that perhaps the creation may attain hearing and sight befitting this Day.”</p>
<p>The ocean of the Bayán surged by the All-Merciful, and the Sun of His grace and bounty has ascended to its zenith. What station does a mere drop possess that it should be mentioned? And what value does a speck of dust hold that it should move?</p>
<p>The Mother Book has appeared, and the Mother of the Bayán speaks! Exalted is our Lord and your Lord, our ultimate aim and yours, and the aim of those in the heavens and on earth!</p>
<p>As for what was written regarding the mention of Áqá Bálá, who is engaged in service to Jináb Áqá ’Alí Ḥaydar—upon him be the glory of God—it was presented, and His blessed and exalted Word flowed:</p>
<p><em>“Indeed, We magnify His face!”</em></p>
<p>We ask God to grant him success in serving the friends and to ordain for him that which is in his best interest.</p>
<p>This lowly servant presents glorification and greetings to the friends of that land, meaning the friends of the True One—glorious is His majesty—and asks God to make each of them as firm as a mountain and as radiant as a shining light. May He increase their sight and hearing at every moment so that they may behold that for which they were created and hear that which was the purpose of the creation of ears to hear.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jináb Áqá ’Alí Akbar Beyk—upon him be the glory of God—and his enkindlement and service in the Cause of God, praise be to God, he has been and remains successful. May he always rise in service and speak in remembrance and praise of the True One—glorious is His majesty! His name has repeatedly flowed from the Most Exalted Pen.</p>
<p>At this very moment, while turning my face toward the Desire of the Worlds, his mention was present. We ask God to open the gates of grace and mercy upon his countenance. Indeed, He is the One who answers the call of those who call upon Him. Praise be to Him, for He is the ultimate aim of those who know!</p>
<p>Glorification, remembrance, and glory be upon you, and upon those with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God—our Lord and your Lord, and the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p><strong>The servant, on the 6th of Rabí‘u’l-Awwal, in the year 1303.</strong></p>
<p>Praise be to God, who has revealed and continues to reveal as He wills. He is the Omnipotent, the Sovereign.</p>
<p>In one of the blessed Tablets, the friends of the land of Q-M-Ṣ were mentioned, as well as the mention of their enkindlement with the fire of God’s love and their yearning for the Most Exalted Horizon. Joy and glad tidings be upon them! Praise be to God, upright souls have been found and have become manifest in that land.</p>
<p>Jináb Ḥájí Sayyid Khalíl—upon him be the glory of God and His grace—has ever been mentioned in the Most Holy Court. God willing, the pages of that land may be illumined by the light of his steadfastness. Likewise, Jináb Áqá Mírzá ’Abdu’r-Raḥím—upon him be the glory of God and His favors.</p>
<p>The details concerning him and the praise of that beloved one were all presented in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted, Most Holy Court, and all attained the endless bounties. This is what has flowed from the Tongue of our Lord in the Kingdom of the Utterance. His blessed and exalted words were:</p>
<p>“He is the Witness, the All-Hearing. O Khalíl, the path is clear, the sign is manifest, the proof is blazing, and the evidence is evident. Yet, the people of the Bayán have clung to the delusions of the past. Reflect upon the heedlessness of this people. With your outward sight, you have seen the losses of the people of the Qur’an and witnessed the outcomes of their deeds and words. And yet, they did not awaken nor did they take heed. Say: Take heed, O you whose countenances have been darkened! Take heed, O you whose pale faces are adorned by the locks of your own deceit! They have no awareness of the Day of God and have not attained to the lights of the true oneness of God.”</p>
<p>That honored one should remain entirely detached from all else and make great efforts to protect the souls, so that past delusions may not return and be renewed again. The story has returned to those who strayed and led others astray. They say again what they had said before, with utmost cunning and deceit striving to mislead the pure souls.</p>
<p>The loud braying which had been raised in the scriptures and Tablets, descending from the Most Exalted Pen, has now ceased. Look into the Kitáb-i-Aqdas at what was revealed concerning Káf and Rá. Today it is clearly witnessed that Ja‘far and his son, among the people of Káf and Rá, have turned away from the truth and opposed it, saying that which no heedless one has said. They have turned away from that Soul—had it been the First Point, it would have circumambulated around Him. And He it is who said:</p>
<p>“I have believed in Him, and I am the first of the worshippers!”</p>
<p>We remember the All-Merciful in this station and magnify Him, and we counsel him toward the greatest steadfastness. His name has been mentioned in the presence of the One before the Countenance.</p>
<p>We have mentioned him with a mention that none other can equal. And We remember all My loved ones, those who have fulfilled the Covenant. We ask God to bring them near to Him in all conditions and to ordain for them what He loves and is pleased with. Indeed, He is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Exalted.</p>
<p>“O My friends in that land, the Amín has mentioned you. We have remembered you as a bounty from Our presence. And I am the All-Knowing Remembrancer.”</p>
<p>In the Most Great Prison, the Wronged One of the world has mentioned you. If the fruits of this mention were to appear to you even the size of the eye of a needle, you would stand in service for the rest of your lives and consider all besides God as perished and lost.</p>
<p>Glory be upon My friends, those who were not hindered by anything, nor were they veiled by the veils of those who disbelieved in God, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>The mercy of God has advanced in a manner beyond description, surpassing all imagination. No tongue can fully recount it, and no pen is worthy to roam this lofty domain. Only through the praise of His friends might one attain a portion, and through the remembrance of His loved ones may one become occupied.</p>
<p>As for the mention of that land, whatever this servant has heard from the Blessed Tongue—if he wished to recount it—would surely find himself incapable and powerless. Exalted is His grace! Magnified is His bounty!</p>
<p>As for what was mentioned concerning Jináb Áqá Mírzá Ghulám-Ḥusayn, Jináb Áqá Mírzá Sayyid ’Alí, and Jináb Áqá Mírzá Muḥammad-Báqir—upon them all be the glory of God—and the mention of their enkindlement, steadfastness, and turning toward the Cause, you have indeed spoken the truth!</p>
<p>In reality, these three pure souls have risen for remembrance, praise, and service to the Cause. Unique and wondrous Tablets have been revealed and sent specifically for them.</p>
<p>After presenting this statement before the Countenance, He—whose Word is truth—said:</p>
<p>“O Amín, the souls were mentioned before the Countenance, and by the grace of God—glorious is His majesty—they attained divine favor. We have remembered them with a remembrance that the treasures of the world and the possessions of the nations cannot equal. We ask God to make each of them like the morning star shining brightly in the sky of certainty. Soon God will manifest upon the earth the stations of those who have turned toward Him and risen to serve His Cause, the Cause through which the foundations of every worldly structure have been shaken, the hearts of every learned jurist have been distressed, and through which the Great Terror has appeared and all who are in the heavens and on earth have been thunderstruck—except those whom God, the Lord of the mighty Throne, has willed.</p>
<p>We further ask God to confirm them in unity and harmony with the people of that land and to grant them success, through wisdom, utterance, spirit, and fragrance, in spreading the Cause. Indeed, He is powerful over all things.”</p>
<p>This lowly servant sends greetings and glorification to each of them and asks the Eternal God for His abiding blessings and favors.</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jináb Muḥammad Riḍá of Muḥammadābād—upon him be the everlasting glory of God—and his services alongside the friends of God, and likewise the praise of his poetry, this lowly servant asks God—exalted is His station—to confirm him in those deeds whose effects remain eternal, and to cause his flowing nature to move through the rivers of His love.</p>
<p>In truth, eloquence, fluency, purity of expression, and a subtle, flowing nature were created especially for the remembrance of God—glorious is His majesty. Blessed is he, and glad tidings be upon him! This matter also attained the honor of being presented before the Throne of the Beloved.</p>
<p>This is what flowed from the Tongue of Grandeur:</p>
<p>“O Muḥammad before Riḍá, by the life of God! Whoever, on this Day, attains even a single drop from this Ocean, or a single letter from this Book, has indeed attained all good—by the testimony of God, the Lord of all worlds. Blessed is the soul that was not withheld by its desires from the Lord of Creation, and was not veiled by the veils of the people of the Bayán, those who turned away from the One who has come down from the heaven of Will with verses that no books of the past or future can equal. This is testified by the Mother Book in this lofty, mighty station.</p>
<p>Say: Look to the Lote-Tree and its fruits, not to what the tongues of the transgressors have uttered.<br>
Say: O people of the Bayán! Come, come, that I may show you the Sun, for it shines from the highest horizon of the world! Fear God, and be not among the wrongdoers.<br>
Say: Lay aside your delusions and suspicions! By God, the All-Sustaining has come with a Cause before which the heavens and the earth cannot stand, if you but know!</p>
<p>By the life of God! We see the people of the Bayán to be more lost than the people of the Qur’an, indeed, more lost than all the religions of the past! This is witnessed by those who have been given insight by God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Thus has spoken the Most Exalted Pen from the most glorious horizon. Blessed is the one who hears and finds the fragrances of the Utterance of the All-Merciful in the realms of existence, and woe to the heedless! Glory shining forth from the horizon of the heaven of My Utterance be upon you and upon the people of My Ark—those who were not prevented by the paths of delusions from My straight path!”</p>
<p>As for the mention of Jináb Muḥammad ’Alí Bahrām—upon him be the glory of God—praise be to God, the clamor of the deniers and the doubts of the unbelievers did not prevent him from turning to the Lord of the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Glorified is God! Glorified is God! Souls have appeared the likes of which, from the beginning of creation until now, have not been seen in their injustice and have not emerged from non-existence into being. They have turned away from the ocean of divine favor, abandoned the kingdom of the Bayán, and occupied themselves with vain imaginings and idle fancies.</p>
<p>By the life of our Beloved and yours, and the Aim of us all and of you all—souls like these have misled the people since the earliest days of Islam and plunged them into suspicions and delusions. These matters are clear and require no detailed explanation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the mention of that noble one was and remains in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court. Praise be to God, they have attained that which has been inscribed by the Most Exalted Pen in the divine Books.</p>
<p>We ask God—glorious is His majesty—to protect them and to adorn them with the everlasting remembrance, so that they may become a banner of the love of God among the people and rise to serve His Cause by night and by day.</p>
<p>In all conditions, this lowly servant prays for the success and confirmation of that beloved one, that God—glorious is His majesty—may increase his station at every moment and grant him fresh and wondrous bounties. Indeed, He is powerful over all things.</p>
<p>Remembrance, glory, and glorification be upon you, and upon those with you, and upon those who love you for the sake of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy.</p>
<p><strong>He is God, exalted is His greatness and magnified is His might!</strong></p>
<p>Before sending this final letter, two other letters from that beloved one were received—one dated the twelfth of the month of Ṣafar, and the other on the first day of Rabí‘u’l-Awwal. Praise be to God! Both conveyed the steadfastness, service, devotion, and attentiveness of that beloved one.</p>
<p>What was written was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court, and His blessed and exalted Word flowed:</p>
<p>“Indeed, he has spoken the truth! Jináb Amín is confirmed in service and, in all his letters, has mentioned the friends of God, their steadfastness, their enkindlement, and their devotion—among the people of N, J, W-Q-M-Ṣ, W-Q-M, and K. Likewise, he mentioned the friends of the lands of Ṭ, Sh, Y, and other regions. May God—glorious is His majesty—grant them all their reward. Indeed, He is the Generous, the Bountiful.”</p>
<p>As for what was written regarding Jináb Áqá Mírzá ’Abdu’lláh and Jináb Áqá Mírzá Ghulám-Ḥusayn—upon them both be the glory of God—and also concerning their steadfastness, love, and generosity, all of it was presented in the Most Holy, Most Exalted Court before the Possessor of the Names. His blessed and exalted Word flowed:</p>
<p>“O ’Abdu’lláh! A letter has arrived from Amín before the Wronged One, and within it was mention of you.<br>
We have remembered you with a remembrance from which every being with a sense of fragrance will perceive the scent of the Utterance of the All-Merciful in the realms of existence. Exalted is the One who has manifested and brought forth whatsoever He willed by His command, for He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful!</p>
<p>Blessed is the soul that has risen for the service of the Cause of God, the Lord of all worlds. Indeed, he is among the people of glory, recorded in the Crimson Tablet, and among the companions of the Ark whose mention was revealed from the heaven of the Will of the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.</p>
<p>Indeed, those who spend in the path of God and fulfill their covenant—these are the servants whom God has mentioned before and after. Every sincere and knowing soul bears witness to this.</p>
<p>O Ghulám before Ḥusayn! Your name has attained the honor of being heard by the Wronged One, and for you, this mighty Tablet has been revealed. Blessed are you, and blessed is the one who acts according to what has been commanded in the Book of God, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy! We ask God, exalted is He, to confirm you both and strengthen you with the hosts of wisdom and utterance, and to send down upon you from the heaven of bounty and grace a blessing from His presence. Indeed, He is the Compassionate, the Bestower, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>Glory be upon you both, and upon every servant who has attained to the service of God, the Possessor of this wondrous Day!”</p>
<p>The outpourings of the ocean of meanings have embraced the two honored ones—upon them be the glory of God. Grace is in the hand of His power; He bestows whatever He wills and grants to whomever He desires. He is not questioned about what He does, for He is the Omnipotent, the Sovereign of All Choices.</p>
<p>Once again, glory, glorification, and praise be upon you and upon every one who has turned and remains firm, steadfast, and upright.</p>
<p><strong>The servant, in the month of Rabí‘u’th-Thání, year 1303.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the Name of Our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious</strong></p>
<p>Praise and thanks, gratitude and exaltation belong to the Master of the Kingdom of Names—He who, out of pure grace and generosity, brought the world out of nonexistence into being, clothed it in the robe of life, and gifted it with the blessing of knowledge so that humanity might come to know Him—the very purpose of creation. Whoever reaches this recognition is adorned with deeds and character that bring healing to the world and peace to the nations.</p>
<p>Joy be upon those whose hearts are not turned away from the Truth by the distractions and misfortunes of the world, nor are they cut off from the path of God. These are the flowing rivers, the lasting stars, the dawning lights, the rising suns of true renown. The servant pleads with his Lord to send His angels to help them, to protect them through His might, and to give them victory with the signs of His triumph. He has power over all things.</p>
<p><strong>O God, O God!</strong></p>
<p>Your servant calls on You by the mysteries of Your Godhood, the radiance of Your Lordship, and by Your command—through which the gardens of Your transcendent majesty bloom with the blossoms of Your grace and loving-kindness. Protect Your friends from the harm of every loud and reckless voice, from every idol-worshipper, and every heedless soul who has turned away from Your proof and evidence, and has broken Your covenant and Your bond. You are the One who holds all power over what You will. There is no God but You, the One who sees, who hears, who knows, and who is wise.</p>
<p>Now, O beloved of my heart: your noble letters have arrived, one after another. Each one is a straight path, a clear and truthful proof, a shining testimony, a living witness in honor of Ḥaḍrat Amín. God’s special favor has embraced him, outward and inward blessings have been given. A hundred thousand thanks to the Desire of the Worlds, who has made His friends the channels of His grace and favor, so that His servants may never be deprived of love and compassion.</p>
<p>After receiving and reading the first letter, dated the 9th of Dhū al-Qa‘dah, numbered 2, he set his sights on the Most Exalted Spot and the Highest Peak. He turned the face of the chosen ones of creation toward the joy of entering the presence. This is what has come down from the heaven of the grace of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the Wise. His Word—blessed and glorious—says:</p>
<p>O Amín, glory be upon you from God, the Lord of all the worlds. We heard your call and listened to what you wrote. Know with clear certainty: the Pen of the Most High has always spoken of His loyal ones and still speaks of them. None but the true friends among humanity can hear this call, which rises from the Highest Horizon. These senseless people have been seized by the sleep of neglect so deeply that, in the Mother Book, they are counted among the dead. Never has the world seen itself so adorned and radiant as it is in these days.</p>
<p>O Amín, today is the day when He says, “All things are in His grasp on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens shall be rolled up in His right hand.” Can anyone claim to recognize this Most Exalted Station, this Lofty Summit? The Primal Point declared: <em>“We are the first to worship,”</em> and yet, look at what has been said and what has come to pass. Implore the True One not to deprive His servants of the light of the Greatest Luminary.</p>
<p>Glory be to God—some maidservants have shown the strength of men, adorned with the robe of understanding, and attained to the highest steadfastness. She is the gracious one; she is the noble. If a withered leaf from the trees advances ahead, it is more honored in the sight of God than those who sit on thrones of rulings and rest on the couches of decrees—those scholars and jurists of the earth.</p>
<p>Alas, alas! The wolf has devoured, and the viper has struck. Give praise to the Desire of the Worlds, who from the direction of the prison has turned His attention toward you and mentioned you. This mention cannot be compared to pearls from matching oceans nor to jewels of kings. The adornments of the world are not remembered in His sight. Blessed is the mention for which one gives his life in the path of God—this is the mention meant by <em>“the remembrance of God is greater.”</em></p>
<p>Throughout all days and nights, this wronged one has been calling out and informing of the tribulations that have come upon him from the people of the Bayán and others. By the life of God, within the garden of the Bayán He has wept and cried out and pleaded, so that perhaps the people of the Bayán might not be tainted with the dust of illusions nor bring sorrow to the Master of existence, the Sovereign of the unseen and seen.</p>
<p>Say: O you who turn away from the Face of God, look with justice and fairness and speak with integrity. The soul who, from the beginning of this Cause until now, has stood before the faces of all, and has proclaimed without veils to everyone—how is it that you now turn away from him and turn instead toward the horizon of delusions? Truly, they are in manifest loss. Yet from the True One—glorious is His majesty—we still seek salvation for this party. What a pity that ears are deprived of hearing, and eyes are barred from seeing.</p>
<p>O Amín, convey praise to the loyal ones among the wronged—those souls who have drunk the cup of eternal life from the hand of bounty, and who have left the world and all that is in it for His sake. Say: Today is a day of grace and mercy, a day of service and of victory. And victory has always been by wisdom and utterance. Its armies are morals and deeds. In most of the Tablets, this exalted word has been revealed so that all may become aware of the will of God, find the purpose, and recognize His hosts.</p>
<p>The Glory shining from the heaven of My grace be upon you and upon those who cast away illusions and hastened to the horizon of certainty. These are the people of Glory, named in the Crimson Scroll and in this clear Tablet. It is complete.</p>
<p>Jewels, pearls, and meaning are hidden within every word—sustainers of the world and knowers among nations. Their worth none can tally. Who can count the bounties and favors of God, His signs and clear proofs? Every learned one has confessed his helplessness, and every knower his limitation. Only the sanctified Self, the All-Encompassing, has ever encompassed it—and shall encompass it still. He suffices as Witness and Knower.</p>
<p>As for what you wrote about Jináb Áqá Qásim Sána‘ Mir’át—upon him be the Glory of God—and his offering of hospitality, it was presented in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted Court. His Word—blessed and exalted—said:</p>
<p>“O Abá’l-Qásim, you have spoken the truth. We mentioned you in another station with a remembrance that caused bodies to tremble, let alone spirits. This is now a second time. Thank God for this immense bounty. We ask Him to strengthen you with the greatest steadfastness, so that neither the treasures of the world nor the multitudes of the nations will hinder you. Your Lord is the Almighty, the Powerful.”</p>
<p>He came from the heaven of the Bayán with proof and evidence, but the people turned away from him, following every ignorant and suspicious soul.</p>
<p>We also mention the one named Mírzá Muḥammad, so he may rejoice in the mention of the wronged one and give thanks to his generous Lord.</p>
<p>O Muḥammad, Muhammad has come to you. The people rejected him. Before him, the Spirit came—people turned away from him and broke God’s covenant and His pledge. Truly, they are in grievous error.<br>
Before him came the Speaker (Moses), bearing signs and proofs—yet the people rose up against him and did what made every just and insightful one weep. Look at what the All-Merciful revealed in the Qur’án: <em>“No messenger comes to them but that they ridicule him.”</em></p>
<p>Blessed is the one who has turned away from such people and clung to the name of the Ever-Living. He belongs to this most lofty station. It is finished.</p>
<p>Ḥaḍrat Ismu’lláh M–ḥ, upon him the Most Glorious of Glories, made mention of Jináb Áqá Mullá Qásim in His presence, and likewise mentioned the tea and its sharing in the sacred gathering. The point was that his action was graced with acceptance—congratulations to him.</p>
<p>As for your mention of Jináb Áqá Muḥammad-Ja‘far and his son Áqá Muḥammad-Mahdí—upon them be the Glory of God—it was presented at the Holy Threshold. These verses came down from the heaven of divine will. His Word—exalted and mighty—is:</p>
<p>“He is the Hearer, the Seer. O Muḥammad-Ja‘far, the Truth is manifest. The people were commanded with what would uplift their being, bring them honor and benefit. The path to Truth was revealed in books and tablets, again and again. They were counseled toward justice, fairness, honesty, and faithfulness. Blessed are the souls who heard the call of the Self-Sufficient and acted upon what was commanded.”</p>
<p>After faithfulness, trustworthiness has always been foremost among virtues, inscribed from the very first word. Its light has outshone all other lights, just as the sun eclipses every beam. Blessed is the soul that became illumined by this light and came to recognize its station. Be not saddened by the trials of time—for all praise belongs to God—you have attained the grace of the Pen of the Most High. Guard this station in the name of the True One, and say: “All praise is Yours, O God of the world and Ruler of the nations. Praise belongs to You, O Desire of the knowers.”</p>
<p>What has come upon you in the path of God—its reward is secured with the Trusted One, meaning the True One, glorified be His majesty. So rejoice and be among the thankful.</p>
<p>We also mention the one named Muḥammad before Mahdí, and we give him glad tidings of the grace of God, the Lord of all worlds. Ḥaḍrat Amín—upon him be My Glory—made mention of you, and so from the hidden pearls of the Bayán, concealed in the treasuries of the Pen of the Most High, We brought forth these words, that you may look toward the horizon of certainty with complete confidence and assurance, and be freed from all else.</p>
<p>Grieve not over the loss of worldly goods. But if that which brings about the elevation of being, and the cause of human perfection, is lost—then it is worth a hundred thousand sighs. We ask God to strengthen you and ordain for you what brings goodness in both this world and the next. He is powerful and able. It is finished.</p>
<p>This servant conveys his praises to him. His letter arrived some time ago, and indeed it caused sorrow. May the True One—glorified be He—continue to counsel His servants toward what is good and toward what draws the people of the world near. There has never been, nor shall there ever be, any doubt that trustworthiness, faithfulness, praiseworthy character, and goodly deeds attract hearts, while the opposite repels them. This exalted word has been flowing from the tongue of the Lord of All from the beginning:</p>
<p>“The True One—blessed and exalted—is revealed through the appearance of meanings from the mine of the human being.”</p>
<p>Throughout nights and days, from the heaven of grace, that which brings dignity to existence has been sent down. This lowly servant asks and hopes from God that He may support His servants and grant them success in what is befitting. He is the compassionate and generous.</p>
<p>Let it be clearly stated that nothing is hidden from God—glorified be He—and the consequence of every deed is known and clear. Had His mercy not gone before all else, many among the people of the world would have been seized by the lashes of wrath. From the True One—glorified be He—I ask for His ancient forgiveness. May He grant His servants success in truthfulness, justice, and fairness. He is the Mighty, the Capable.</p>
<p>As for what was written about Jináb Áqá Shaykh Ḥasan—upon him be the Glory of God—that four túmáns were given to him, and likewise nineteen qiráns to the emigrants of the land of S–d—upon them be the Glory of God—and other such matters, it was presented in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted Court. It was declared: “Whatever is given to the friends of God is accepted and approved. Permission has already been given—do not hold back in supporting the companions to the extent of your ability. If only, instead of nineteen qiráns, nineteen túmáns had been given!”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>Though that beloved of the heart is well aware of the conditions of that land, still, the poor of those regions are always in the sight of God—glorified be He. Blessed is the one who, according to their means, looks after their needs. The command is His, and He is the all-bountiful, the generous.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Pen of the Most High makes mention of the friends in Qamsar and Mázgan. His Word—blessed and exalted—says:</p>
<p>“O My loved ones! Listen to the call of the Wronged One in the Persian tongue. Praise be to God—you are remembered before His Face and have attained special grace. Out of wisdom, We veiled your names. God acts according to the demands of His wisdom and has instructed all to do the same. Praise be to God—even in this Most Great Prison, attention has repeatedly turned toward those regions, and mention has been made of His loved ones.”</p>
<p>Ḥaḍrat Amín—upon him be My Glory and favor—mentioned you, and the Wronged One has specially prayed for you all.</p>
<p>We ask God to strengthen you in what He loves and is pleased with, to draw you nearer to Himself, and to record for you the reward of those who soared in the atmosphere of His love, heard His call, turned toward His horizon, stood before the gate of His grandeur, and gave their lives in His path. Rejoice, My friends. Be glad, My beloved, for what has been revealed about you by My Pen in this noble and wondrous spot, called the Most Great Prison—because of what the heedless have done. The Glory from Our presence be upon you and upon those who have turned away from what the people possess and turned instead to God, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>As for what was written concerning the son of Ḥaḍrat-i-Shahíd—upon them be the Glory of God—it was presented and accepted at the Most Exalted Court. The mention of each one was made from the tongue of majesty.</p>
<p>Blessed are the souls who have been confirmed in generosity and who, to the extent of their means, have spent and continue to spend in the path of God. That Presence gives good news to all of this supreme bounty. This lowly servant humbly asks the Exalted Lord to strengthen those who give in His path, so they may fulfill what they have pledged. He is the Strengthener, the Forgiving, the Merciful.</p>
<p>On this blessed night, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke this exalted word: “O Amín! You did not mention Nawwáb—upon him be My Glory—in this letter. Seeing your display of loyalty, We now mention him and ask the Exalted God to grant him that which brings an everlasting reward and an eternal remembrance.”</p>
<p>O Nawwáb, the Bestower speaks: “The world is fleeting. At every moment, its changes are manifest, its perishability apparent. Praise be to God, that noble soul attained that which is mentioned in the Kingdom of God.”</p>
<p>Guard this most honored and exalted station, and say:</p>
<p>“O God, O Lord! O Generous, Merciful, Self-Sufficient One—You have shown favor and bestowed grace.<br>
You drew me from the north of illusion to the right hand of certainty. You guided me from the crooked path of the people to the straight path and the Great Announcement. No words can adequately thank You for Your gifts. Nothing can match them. I ask You: do not deprive me of the rain of Your mercy. Guard me with the power of Your might. You are the All-Hearing, the All-Powerful.”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>This lowly one sends his praises to him and asks the Exalted God to ignite within him a fire from the heat of His love and to grant him eternal life from the Kawthar of the Bayán, flowing from His Pen, so that from him may appear that which endures with the everlasting dominion of His kingdom and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Now, the mention of the spiritual friend, Ḥájí Sayyid Naṣru’lláh—upon him be the Glory of God—has been made, along with his mother and his wife, Varqah the daughter of his cousin, and the noble aunt—upon them all be the Glory of God.</p>
<p>Mention was also made of their hardships, their services, and their hospitality. All of it was presented in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted Court. For each one, something was specially revealed—words that this servant is powerless to count or comprehend. The waves of the ocean of His bounty cannot be numbered—nor will they ever be.</p>
<p>Who is able to speak or count what has appeared from a station that cannot be pointed to by any sign, nor described by any description, nor encompassed by any mention?</p>
<p>Truly, the mentioned souls have attained that which the people of the world are deprived of—except those whom our Lord, and your Lord, and the Lord of the Great Throne has willed.</p>
<p>I send my praise and greetings to the service of each one.</p>
<p>The efforts of the spiritual friend Ḥájí Sayyid Naṣru’lláh—upon him be the Glory of God—and his care have truly been a cause of eternal comfort and everlasting favor. From the garden of appearance, it is clear and evident. Praise be to God—their mention has been and still is in the Sacred Court. Congratulations to him, and may it be a source of joy for him.</p>
<p>And as for the mention of Ḥakím Rayḥán and his son, as well as their hospitality—it was presented before the throne of the Lord, and these exalted words were revealed:</p>
<p>“O Abá’l-Ḥasan, mention each of them on behalf of the Wronged One, and say: The desire of this Wronged One is that the world be illumined with the light of unity, and that the rancor and hatred in the hearts of factions be transformed into love and harmony. We have mentioned what brings about the refinement of souls, the reformation of the world, and the elevation and advancement of nations. We ask God to aid all people in acting upon what has been revealed from the Pen of the Most High in the Tablets.”</p>
<p>He is the Strengthener, the Generous.</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, all the mentioned souls have attained the remembrance of God and are adorned with His favor. What tongue can fulfill the thanks owed? What soul can cling to what is truly deserved? All are seen to fall short and be deficient—except those who have been adorned with His remembrance, supported by His praise, and risen to serve His Cause.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who act. Blessed are the steadfast.</p>
<p>Now, it was written that today I am a guest at the home of Jináb Áqá Muḥammad-Ḥusayn ’Amú-Zaynal—upon him be the Glory of God. A prayer was offered on behalf of the souls gathered there, asking the Exalted Lord for blessings—and it was answered.</p>
<p>After presenting these verses, from the rising place of grace, this Word shone forth:</p>
<p>“O Mírzá Ḥasan, your remembrance by Amín is everlasting. We have mentioned you with what shall never end. Know it by the enduring realm of the Kingdom of God, the Lord of all the worlds. Guard this Most Exalted Station in My Name—the Mighty, the Wondrous.</p>
<p>O ’Alí Áqá Ḥasan! ’Alí appeared, and those who claimed love for ’Alí cursed Him, and eventually they martyred Him. We ask God that the peoples of the world not fall into the same illusions as the Shí‘ah faction. He is the Powerful, the Mighty.</p>
<p>O Merciful One—Visible Light, Radiant Sun, Flaming Fire, Manifestation Revealed! Yet the people remain heedless and veiled. Blessed is the soul who recognized the station of the Day of God and rose for what was right.</p>
<p>O ’Alí Ismá‘íl! Ask the Shí‘ah: what was the outcome of your deeds on the Day of Return? What became of them? They did deeds no other faction in the world has done. Woe to them, and to those whom they misled.</p>
<p>O Jamshíd, from the fire of divine love the light has appeared. Today is the Day. Union was attained—Mount Sinai through the One who spoke from it, and the Lote Tree through its fire. Blessed are the souls who saw and understood. Woe to the heedless.</p>
<p>O Mashhadī Ḥusayn, your name was present in the Most Sanctified and Exalted Court; therefore, We turned to you and mentioned you. Know the station of this mention, and by the name of the True One, conceal it from the eyes of the heedless.</p>
<p>O ’Alī-Akbar, Owner of worth in the Greater Realm, We mentioned you so you may thank your generous Lord. Praise be to God—you appeared, you attained, and you drank from the chalice of the sovereign of the worlds. Your Lord is the Bestower, the Mighty, the Great.</p>
<p>O Ḥusayn ’Amú-Zaynal, Amín—upon him be My Glory—has mentioned you and your household. Blessed is the household in which My loved ones gather, from which My remembrance and praise rise. We ask God to protect you, draw you near, and ordain for you the best in this world and the next. We ask the True One to make you steadfast in His Cause, to inspire you to speak His remembrance, and to trengthen you in serving His loved ones. He is the Most Merciful of the merciful, the Answerer of those who call.</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, each one has attained boundless favors. The favor of the True One—glorified be He—has encompassed the world. Today, a mere pebble is engaged in remembrance and praise, while many souls are deprived and barred. Glory be to our Lord! What a strange enchantment—eyes are blind and ears are deaf. The matter is in the hand of God, the Lord of Might.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jináb Ghulám-’Alī—upon him be the Glory of God. His name has repeatedly flowed from the Pen of the Most High. On a particular day, a Tablet was revealed in the field bearing his name, and mention of his son was also included in that blessed Tablet. We ask the True One to elevate and bless them both.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of Jináb Áqá Muḥammad Hāshim and Áqá Muḥammad, sons of Áqá Ḥusayn—upon them be the Glory of God. After being presented in His Presence, these verses specifically for them were revealed: Blessed and Exalted is He who says:</p>
<p>“O My loved ones! The Wronged One remembers you from the direction of the prison and brings you glad tidings of the grace of God, the Master of the Day of Judgment. The gates of heaven have opened, and its rider has arrived by a clear command. He remembers those who turned toward Him, who attained, who drank the wine of knowledge from the hand of their generous Lord. Take what has been sent down to you with strength, from God—the One, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. The Glory be upon both of you, and upon those who cast away idols and turned swiftly to the All-Knowing, the Wise.”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>Mention was also made of Jináb Ḥájí Nabíl, previously known as Ḥāl-Ṭ—upon him be the Glory of God.<br>
Favor has been and continues to be shown to him. It was said:</p>
<p>From the beginning of days, he arose in service. God willing, until the end of days, he will look toward the Exalted Horizon, cling to the cord of grace, and hold fast to the hem of divine favor. When he departed from the Land of Desire, special protection was bestowed upon him. Praise be to God—he attained the ocean of divine forgiveness. He has always been and continues to be under divine care. We ask God to grant him success and ordain for him the best of this world and the next.</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>As for the mention of the nephew who turned away: After being presented before the Face, these verses were revealed:</p>
<p>Exalted and Blessed is He who says:<br>
“He is the Witness, the All-Aware. O ’Alī-Akbar, you were mentioned in the letter of Jináb Amín; therefore, the attention of the Wronged One turned toward you. We ask God to confirm you in such a way that the doubts and hints of the people of the world do not prevent you from reaching the goal.<br>
Throughout centuries and ages, the Shí‘ah sought the Truth and longed for Him. When He appeared, they martyred Him. Give thanks to the Desire of the Worlds, who confirmed you and guided you to the Straight Path and the Great Announcement.</p>
<p>Say: O God, O my God! I have turned to You, cutting myself off from all else. I ask You by the ocean of Your verses, by the heaven of Your signs, and by the hearts that soared to You longing for Your presence,<br>
to strengthen me in Your remembrance, to make me successful in serving Your Cause. You are the Lord of the worlds, the Master of eternity, enthroned upon the Most Glorious Throne. There is no God but You, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>Likewise, mention was made of Áqá ’Alí and Áqá Ḥasan—upon them be the Glory of God. Exalted and Blessed is He who says:</p>
<p>“O ’Alī, blessed are you and your father, who is named Ḥasan. We ask the True One to give you the cup of steadfastness in such a way that the world will not be able to stop you. Take the Book of God with hands of submission and contentment, and guard it with the strength and power of His Cause. Whoever attains today is among those brought near in the presence of God. He is the Guardian of the sincere. There is no God but Him, the One, the All-Knowing, the Wise.”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>The second letter from that beloved was dated the 25th of Dhū al-Ḥijjah, number 3. The final letter was the 29th of Dhū al-Ḥijjah, number 4.</p>
<p>The hut became a palace, the eye became a sea, and in the Most Exalted Horizon, he attained hearing. Yet what descended from the heaven of grace is beyond the ability of this lowly writer to inscribe. That beloved of the heart has seen the waves of the ocean of grace and knows them. A hundred thousand glad-tidings to the souls who, in this spiritual springtime, have been showered by the rains of the merciful Bayán.</p>
<p>Mention was made of arrival at the land of Yā and prior to that, attention to the letters “Alif” and “Rā’” and before that, the land of “S.” Likewise, mention was made of Jináb Mírzá R– and Jináb Mírzá M– Ḥ–—upon them be the Light—and the friends of God—upon them be the Glory of God—in that land. These matters were presented before the presence of the All-Holy. This is what was sent down from the heaven of the will of our Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.</p>
<p>His Word—exalted be His majesty—says:</p>
<p>“O Amín, upon you be My Glory. Those affiliated with Fath-i-A‘ẓam—upon him be My Glory and My grace—are likewise remembered. The friends in that land have ever been and remain mentioned in the Sacred Court.</p>
<p>For Rafī‘—upon him be My Glory—and Muḥammad—upon him be My favor, two most sanctified Tablets were sent down from the heaven of the All-Merciful’s grace. God willing, they will drink from the Ocean of the Bayán and be illumined by the lights of the Luminary of meaning.”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>Praise be to God—what was revealed for them is enough to raise decayed bones and adorn the world of heedlessness with the robe of awareness. Likewise, for all the friends in that land, both male and female, there was revealed what nothing in this world can compare to. We ask the Exalted God to grant them all the Most Great Gladness.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Varqah, the noble lady, the mother of Mírzá Ḥasan—upon her be the Glory of God.<br>
After it was presented at the Most Sanctified Threshold, this exalted word descended from the realm above:</p>
<p>Exalted and Blessed is He who says:</p>
<p>“O My maidservant, Amín—upon him be My Glory—has mentioned you. He also made mention of Muḥammad before Ḥasan, and has asked for grace on your behalf. Therefore, a Radiant Light has shone from the heaven of the Pen of the Most High through your remembrance. You have been granted this station. God willing, you will remain firm in His love. The world’s illusions have deprived the nations from the Eternal One. Blessed is the community that turned and attained. Woe to the heedless women and heedless men.”</p>
<p>I advise you to fear God and to uphold what brings about sanctity and purification.</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>As for what was written about the relative of Jináb Nāẓir—upon him be the Glory of God—yes, by command, this servant sent a remittance of 150 [currency units], and no more.</p>
<p>Mention was made of Jináb Ḥájí Malik Ḥusayn—upon him be the Glory of God—and what befell him. It was presented at the Most Sanctified Court. He attained the honor of presentation, and these words were revealed:</p>
<p>Exalted and Blessed is He who says: “O Ḥusayn, the tongue of the Bayán, in the Kingdom of divine knowledge, at this very hour—two hours past nightfall—remembers you. From the direction of the prison, We have turned toward you. The treasures of the world and the wealth of the nations are not equal to this exalted word, revealed from the dawning of the Will of the Lord of All. The matter is in His hands, and wealth is in the grip of His power. Perishing wealth brought about lasting mention. By the Sun of Reality, gain is with you, and loss is with the one who took it away. Your Lord is the All-Powerful, the Chosen One. He changes the matter as He wills. He is the Mighty, the Bestower.”</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>In truth, after hearing what happened to him, a boundless sorrow appeared. But after being presented at the Court and after the verses were revealed, the ocean of joy became manifest. Nothing in the world can compare with what was sent down. Every sincere and trustworthy one bears witness to this.The matter is in the hands of God—our Lord and the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p>The fifth letter, dated the 21st of the month of Muḥarram, from that beloved, arrived and was presented.</p>
<p>In reply, these verses were revealed from the Manifestation of Clear Proofs:</p>
<p>Exalted and Blessed is He who says: “O Amín, We heard your call and mentioned you repeatedly. The Ocean of the Bayán is ever surging, and the cities of remembrance and praise are adorned by the Will of the Lord of Names. Blessed is the soul that possesses hearing and attains to listening, and likewise sight.<br>
Convey remembrance, praise, grace, and kindness from the Wronged One to the friends of those regions.”</p>
<p>You mentioned Jináb Ghulám—upon him be My Glory. His name matches his meaning. He came into the Presence and drank the wine of the Bayán from the cup of his generous, gracious Lord. We ask the Exalted God to raise him to a station where worldly matters—whether high or low, beautiful or ugly—shall have no influence over him. Let him remain seated upon the throne of assurance, and rest upon the seat of certainty. He has attained to what is good, from the Source of all good. The Lord of all peoples testifies to this in His days—and He suffices as a Witness.</p>
<p>We send praise upon him and peace from the All-Knowing, the All-Wise God.</p>
<p>You made mention of Jináb M. Ḥ. before Riḍā—upon him be the Glory of God. He has attained to the Kawthar of divine remembrance. We mentioned him before, and now once again the Wronged One gives him glad-tidings. We ask God to strengthen him in that which brings him nearer to His presence, so that every world of his worlds may blossom, and the Pen of the Most High may inscribe for him the best of this world and the next. He is truly generous and bountiful.</p>
<p>O Amín, the souls mentioned in these pages have each attained that which has no likeness or equal. Give them glad-tidings of My grace and mercy, which preceded all existence, whether hidden or manifest.</p>
<p>It is finished.</p>
<p>This lowly servant sends greetings and praise to the loved ones, especially the honored ones—upon them be the Glory of the Most Glorious—who were present at that gathering. Congratulations to them. Joy be upon them. Praise belongs to our Lord, and thanks to Him for adorning them with the first robe—His love, glorified and exalted be He. He supported them, made them to know, and caused them to hear on a day when eyes were blind and ears were deaf. Thus has the bounty of our Lord, and your Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, encompassed all things.</p>
<p>We ask the Exalted God to strengthen each one of them to guide the people. He is the One who, when He says <em>Be</em>, it is.</p>
<p>At this point, replies to that Beloved’s letters were recorded one by one. Each line of praise and thanks—bearing the noblest of names—became a volume testifying to the blessings of God and a record of the outpouring of the All-Merciful’s mercy. Praise be to God—that beloved one has tasted the sweetness of affirmation and acknowledgment. By the will of the Exalted God, they have expressed what is most fitting.</p>
<p>The purpose is this: your words and your actions were adorned with acceptance in the Most Sanctified, Most Exalted Court.</p>
<p>We give thanks to God, our Lord and the Lord of the earth and the heavens, who created us, made Himself known to us, and enabled us to mention Him and praise Him on this wondrous and mighty Day.</p>
<p>Glory and praise be upon your presence, and upon those with you. He hears your words in the remembrance of God—your Lord and our Lord, the Lord of the Mighty Throne and the Lord of the lofty Seat.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, the Mighty, the Inaccessible.</p>
<p>Khadim-Ādam — 22nd of the month of Rabī‘ al-Awwal, year 1305 (December 20, 1887)</p>
