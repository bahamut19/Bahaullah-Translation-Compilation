# BH00721 (Letter about Purity) {#sec-bh00721 .unnumbered}

He is God, exalted is His majesty, greatness, and power.

1 Your writing has been received, and its fragrances brought immense delight and joy. God willing, at all times, the pen of the loved ones of the Merciful will flow with that which brings spirit and bliss to creation. As a question was posed, this servant deemed it necessary to hasten to write a response and send it, so that the truth of the matter becomes clear and evident to you and to the other friends. Although the sanctity and purity of the Cause are as manifest as the sun at its zenith, I will, given your request, convey the following: You mentioned that you have been perplexed by the behavior of certain individuals. Someone like you should never be perplexed by such matters.

2 In such matters, one should never feel perplexed. You have spent considerable time in the Sacred Court and have heard, directly and publicly, many of the divine utterances that serve as the cause of training humanity and elevating the peoples of the world. Whoever acts contrary to these teachings is deprived and a loser, as has been stated: *“Even if they are among close kin.”* Some of these actions are remnants of the early habits of the people of the Bayán, which were widespread among them and were practiced without right. As you and the other friends are aware, before this Most Great Manifestation, many of the people of the Bayán acted in ways that were neither in accordance with any nation nor in conformity with any religion, and no rational or discerning person would have accepted them. Then the Sun of Manifestation shone forth. From the years spent in Iraq until the 17th day of Jumádá al-Thání in the year 1291, successive and continuous Tablets descended from the heaven of divine will.

3 In these Tablets, new and wondrous teachings were revealed, prohibiting all from detestable and unacceptable practices and enjoining all to adhere to the commands of God, which are the means of salvation for all. From the horizon of each Tablet, the Sun of the Word has risen and shone in this regard. Today, it is incumbent upon everyone to cling to the cord of sanctity and to seize the hem of purity. O brother, the pearls of the Cause remain veiled by unworthy deeds. This is the fundamental reason why humanity has been held back. Otherwise, from all directions and lands, you would hear the call: *“Verily, I have turned toward You and hastened to You, O Desire of the worlds!”* In Iraq, after the Orb of Realities had risen, all were forbidden from certain actions. Some obeyed and refrained, while others, even though under the shadow of Truth, continued to act as they did before. However, such actions were veiled. Likewise, in this land, there is no apparent authority to enforce the bounds of God.

4 Therefore, the bounds of God cannot be implemented. The Truth has been oppressed and will remain so. Only a few close souls hear His voice. This is why the actions of those who adhere to pure knowledge revealed for God's sake cannot be equated with the deeds of others. There is no fear of worldly retribution, so if any goodness manifests from a soul, it is for the sake of God and is therefore considered among the highest of deeds. By God, there is no deity but Him. Every soul, male or female, who has come to this land, when in the presence of the Sun, has been enjoined to exhibit praiseworthy morals, spiritual actions, pleasing attributes, and to avoid selfish desires. Blessed is the one who attains success, and woe to the heedless. Exalted is His majesty! He has declared: *“Adultery, sodomy, and treachery are forbidden to you. Avoid them, O people who turn toward Me. By God, you were created to purify the world from the defilement of passions.”*

5 This is what your Lord, the Master of existence, commands you, if you are among the discerning. Whoever attributes themselves to the Merciful and acts according to the deeds of Satan is not of Me. This is testified by all atoms and stones, all trees and fruits, and beyond them, this Truthful, Trustworthy Tongue. These sublime words have descended from the mouth of the Revealer of verses, and this servant has presented them in writing. Whoever acts, it is for their own soul, and whoever turns away, it is to their own detriment. Verily, our Lord, the All-Knowing, is the Self-Sufficient, the Praised One.

6 If people knew how much harm, sorrow, and grief these matters have caused the Eternal Beauty, all would turn toward Him and engage in lamentation. In the early days, certain actions of the leaders of the Bayán caused veils and delays for humanity. If this servant were to recount the deeds of some, which I have personally witnessed, it would cause astonishment for all. If this Most Great Manifestation had not appeared, the matter would have remained ambiguous for the majority of people. Through divine grace and firm Tablets, many of the friends residing in cities and villages across the world have attained the garment of sanctity. In some regions, they have earnestly and diligently acted according to the divine ordinances, which are the cause of humanity's benefit, and have purified themselves from rejected actions. However, some remain attached to their old habits. We beseech God to grant everyone success in acting in a manner befitting His days, worthy of His beauty, and that He may exalt His firmly established and mighty Cause.

7 O my dear one, the majority of souls are weak in spirit; as soon as they witness a spark, they melt like snow before a flame. Where are those steadfast, stable, and composed souls? The ones of whom it is said that if all the women of the world, adorned with all beauty and finery, appeared before them, and all the treasures of the world were displayed to them they would never incline towards them. This is because such souls are intoxicated with the wine of the beauty of the Lord of Glory. Their drunkenness is the sovereign of effacement, and their sobriety is the source of obliteration.

8 Consider: Moses emerged from the house of Pharaoh, and Abu Lahab came from the lineage of Prophethood. God willing, at all times, you may fix your gaze on the highest horizon and dedicate yourself fully to breaking the idols of self. Perhaps, through your efforts and those of the friends of Truth, the unacceptable deeds that have caused veils for humanity may be eradicated from among the people.

9 In these days, this noble verse has descended from the Pen of the Most High: *“It is incumbent upon everyone who has believed in God to hasten, proclaim the truth, and strive to remove falsehood from among the people.”*

10 All must rise to serve in a way that sanctifies spirits and elevates the inhabitants of the world. In times past, observe the actions of the Messenger of God (peace be upon Him). On the day that that praiseworthy Beauty ascended, nearly one hundred thousand individuals from the surrounding areas of Medina had gathered around Him. Many of those souls were considered companions in appearance, as they had been in His presence. Yet, those who were truly steadfast and God-fearing were but a few. *“Indeed, grace is in the hand of God; He grants it to whomever He wills by His command, for He is the All-Powerful, the Almighty.”*

11 In truth, your question was very pleasing, as most people are weak and unaware of what pleases God and what is beloved in His sight. From your letter, the sincerity of Ibn ‘Abdulláh, the devoted ones, is understood. It reveals what is loved and accepted by God. The fragrances of the garment of the Merciful are diffused throughout creation. We praise Him and thank Him for this, for He is the Guardian of the grateful.

12 Convey to His Honor, the Most Truthful Name of God, crowned with the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s splendor, endless praise, supreme sanctity, and inviolable purity, this humble servant’s sentiments. To the other friends, upon whom be the fragrances of God, I remain a supplicant, remembering all and hoping that they will not forget this servant in their prayers. *“Indeed, glory be upon you and upon them.”*
