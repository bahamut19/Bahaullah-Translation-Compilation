# Lawh-i-Ayat-i-Nur (Tablet of the Light Verse) {#sec-lawh-i-ayat-i-nur .unnumbered}

In the name of God, the Glorious, the Most Glorious.

## The Letters Were Created

1\) Praise be to God who created the letters in the worlds of obscurity, behind the veils of sanctity, in the heights of the Most Exalted. He then nourished them from the chalices of perpetuity, as He had ordained in the Tablets of Decree, to revive the hearts of those drawn near in the realm of execution. He then clothed them with the garment of blackness, according to His eternal predestination, in the hidden recesses of destiny, upon the crimson domes, surpassing all prior knowledge, so as to conceal the water of life in the darkness of the realms of names at the Lote Tree of the Limit. Then He sent them down to the realm of creation in the air of destiny.

## The Dot Was Manifested After 140,000 Years

2\) Then the voice emerged from the Most High abode, addressing the First Pen, saying, "O Pen, write from the secrets of the Ancient onto the luminous white tablet." Upon hearing this call, the Pen swooned in yearning for seventy thousand years beyond what the counters could count. When it revived, as determined by the divine decree, it wept for another seventy thousand years with tears of crimson. Then it stood before God in a time that was preceded by the ruling of the Primordial Beginning and is not followed by the ruling of the Ultimate End. When it was burned by the fire of separation after the sweet call ceased, its tears took on the color of blackness in the realm of fidelity. A drop of these black tears fell onto the tablet. Then appeared the dot in the world of origination. This dot manifested itself with the embroidery of the Primordial in the mirrors of the letters within the realities of the names.

3\) Then the Alif received it before all other letters in the scattering of things and detailed this divine dot in the embroidery of this eternal Alif, as the breezes of the Merciful blew upon it from the source of Oneness. Then the face of unity was unveiled behind the green veils, and the structure of the dot appeared in the form of Alif and stood on the tablet as it stood upon the command of the Most High God in the world of attributes and names. This is the station where the essence of Will wore the robe of Nomenclature and shed the attire of Qualities in the city of Grandeur.
