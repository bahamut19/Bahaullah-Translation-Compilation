# Welcome!

This book is a provisional translation of Baha'u'llah's Writings. All items are taken from the original Arabic and Persian from various sources and translated using the latest version of OpenAI's GPT.

There are thousands of works which have not been translated yet. Some of which had been translated, especially that of the Administrative Order of the Baha'i Faith, introduces various biases to promote certain ideas which may not be perfectly true to the intentions of Baha'u'llah.

We acknowledge GPT is imperfect, but we can acknowledge it is unbiased in that it was trained from many data points, some of which may favor a perspective, but the totality of all data points should bring the translation as close to a neutral voice as possible. We hope you find this book useful. You are welcome to share it as you see fit.

Yeah babayyyy
