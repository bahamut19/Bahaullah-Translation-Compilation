1 He is the Everlasting One in the most resplendent horizon.
The command of Allah has come upon shadows of explanation, and the polytheists on that day will be in great torment. The armies of Revelation have descended with the banners of inspiration from the heaven of the Tablet in the name of Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful. Then, the monotheists will rejoice with the victory of Allah and His dominion, while the deniers will be in manifest confusion at that time.
2 O people, do you turn away from the mercy of Allah after it has encompassed all possibilities created between the heavens and the earth? Do not exchange the mercy of Allah upon yourselves, nor deprive yourselves of it. Whoever turns away from it is indeed in great loss. The example of mercy is like that of the verses; it has been sent down from a single heaven. The monotheists are given to drink from it the wine of life, while the polytheists drink from the scalding water. And when the verses of Allah are recited to them, hatred's fire ignites in their chests; thus, they have exchanged the blessings of Allah upon themselves and have become among the heedless.
Enter, O people, under the shade of the Word, then drink from it the nectar of meanings and explanation, for in it are the treasures of the abundant Kawthar of the Most Exalted. It has appeared from the horizon of your Lord's will, the Most Merciful, with marvelous lights.
3 Say, the Sea of Eternity has branched out from this Greatest Ocean, so blessed are those who settle on its shore and become among the steadfast. And from the Sidrat al-Muntaha, this most resplendent, sacred temple has branched out as a branch of holiness. Congratulations to those who seek shade under its shadow and become among the tranquil ones.
4 Say, the branch of the Divine Command has grown from this firmly established root that Allah has anchored in the land of His Will, and its offshoot has risen to a station encompassing all existence. Exalted is He from this sublime, blessed, mighty, and impregnable creation. O people, draw near to it and taste from it the fruits of wisdom and knowledge from the presence of a Mighty, All-Knowing One. Whoever does not taste from it will be deprived of the blessings of Allah, even if they are provided with everything on earth, if you are among those who know.
5 Say, a word has been detailed from the Greatest Tablet by virtue of grace, and Allah has adorned it with the embroidery of His Own Self, making it a sovereign authority over all on earth and a sign of His greatness and omnipotence among the worlds. So that people may glorify their Mighty, All-Powerful, Wise Lord through it, and extol their Creator, and sanctify the Self of Allah, Who stands above all things. This is nothing but a revelation from the presence of the Ancient, All-Knowing One.
6 Say, O people, be grateful to Allah for His appearance, for it is the greatest favor upon you and the most perfect blessing for you. With it, every decayed bone is revived. Whoever turns to it has turned to Allah, and whoever turns away from it has turned away from My beauty, denied My proof, and is among the extravagant. It is indeed the trust of Allah among you and His covenant within you, its appearance upon you, and its rise among His close servants. Thus, I was commanded to convey to you the message of Allah, your Creator, and I have delivered to you what I was commanded. Then, let Allah bear witness to that, followed by His angels, His messengers, and His sanctified servants.
7 Breathe in the fragrance of divine pleasure from its emanations and do not be among the deprived. Seize the grace of Allah upon you and do not hide from it. Indeed, We have sent it upon the temple of mankind, so blessed is Allah, the Originator of what He wills by His Wise, Decisive command. Those who have withheld themselves from the shade of the branch have wandered in the wilderness, and the heat of passion has consumed them, and they were among the perished.
8 Hurry, O people, to the shade of Allah so that He may protect you from the heat of a day when no one will find any shade or refuge for themselves except the shade of His name, the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. O people, put on the garment of certainty so that it may protect you from the assault of doubts and illusions, and that you may be among the believers during these days when no one will be certain or settle upon the matter except by detaching themselves from everything in the hands of people and turning towards a luminous, sacred scene.
9 O people, do you take falsehood as a source of aid for yourselves besides Allah, and follow the rebellious ones as lords other than your Lord, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful? O people, abandon their remembrance, then take the cup of vitality in the name of your Lord, the Most Compassionate. By Allah, with just a drop of it, potentiality comes to life if you are among those who possess knowledge. Say, today there is no protection for anyone from the decree of Allah, nor is there a refuge for a soul except in Allah, and this is the absolute truth, and anything beyond the truth is nothing but clear misguidance.
10 Indeed, Allah has decreed upon every soul to convey His command to the best of their ability. Thus, the matter has been determined by the Finger of Power and Authority upon the Tablets of Mighty Esteem. Whoever revives a soul in this matter is as if they have revived all the servants, and Allah will raise them on the Day of Resurrection in the pleasure of the Oneness, adorned by His own sovereign, mighty, and generous Self. Indeed, this is the support from your Lord, and apart from this, nothing will be mentioned today in the presence of Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your ancient forefathers.
11 Indeed, you, O servant, listen to what We have instructed you in the Tablet, then seek the bounty of your Lord at all times. Then spread the Tablet before those who believe in Allah and His signs so that they may convey what is in it and be among the doers of good.
12 Say, O people, do not spread corruption on the earth and do not argue with people, for this was not the way of those who took shelter in the shadow of their Lord, who were on the path of truth and trust. And if you find someone thirsty, give them a drink from the cup of Kawthar and Tasneem. And if you find someone with receptive ears, recite to them the verses of Allah, the Almighty, the Mighty, the Merciful.
13 Open your tongue with good speech and then remind the people if you find them receptive to the sanctity of Allah; otherwise, invite them with their own selves and then leave them at the origin of Hellfire. Beware not to spread the pearls of meaning to every blind and barren person. Indeed, the blind one is deprived of seeing the lights and will not distinguish the stone from a precious sacred pearl. If you were to recite a thousand years of marvelous verses of glory upon a stone, would it understand or be affected by it? No, by your Merciful and Compassionate Lord. And if you recite all the verses to a deaf person, would they hear a single letter from them? No, by the ancient glory's beauty.
14 Thus, We have cast upon you from the jewels of wisdom and eloquence so that you may gaze towards your Lord's direction and detach yourself from the worlds. The spirit is upon you and upon those who have settled at the abode of holiness and have been steadfast in the command of their Lord, on a clear and straight path.
