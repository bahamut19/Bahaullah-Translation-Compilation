Your Lord speaks as He wills, just as He ordains as He desires; indeed, He is the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. Those who are heedless today of what has been revealed within creation are surely among the most heedless of servants in the Book of God, the Lord of the worlds. You have attained before to the verses of God and His mercy—rejoice in this bounty! By My life, nothing in the world can compare to this favor. Truly, your Lord is the Most Generous and Bountiful. We have granted what We desired for you above what you desired for yourself. Your Lord knows you better than you know yourself; verily, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.

We desire that you remember your Lord with spirit and joy for the people of the world—those in whose faces you perceive the radiance of submission to God, the Almighty, the Praiseworthy. He writes a reward for those who yearn for His meeting and to enter the sanctuary of His nearness. Nothing can hinder Him from fulfilling His will. He does as He pleases, and He ordains as He desires; He is the One, the All-Knowing. Such is your Lord, the Ocean of Meanings, sailing the ark of wisdom of your Lord, the All-Forgiving, the Merciful.

Blessings be upon you and upon your household, whose hearts are illumined with the light of God’s love and who have turned in recognition when the Promised One came with clear proof. He is God! Praise be to God, the One, the Peerless, the Unique.

He who created humanity and inspired within them the capacity to manifest the attributes of the Most Merciful, and who created Satan to distinguish those who turn toward the Most Exalted Horizon from those who follow their base desires—exalted is He, beyond my mention and the mention of all who dwell in the heavens and the earth. To Him belong creation and command; He gives life and causes death, and He is the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent.

This servant presented a detailed response some time ago to your noble correspondence, adorned with words and verses of God. However, its dispatch was delayed until two additional letters arrived. Praise be to God, all were expressive of your submission, humility, and dedication to the Cause of God. The letter addressed to His Eminence Samjoud (exalted be His glory) also reached Him, and all were presented before His presence.

This is what has dawned from the horizon of the explanation: O Ali, We have heard your call, your mention, and your supplication, repeated over and over. Therefore, hear what God calls to you repeatedly. We have remembered you and continue to remember you so that you may arise in the Cause of your Lord with a determination that raises the banner of unity upon the highest standard.

What you sent forth has been presented in the presence of this servant and a response descended from the kingdom of revelation. God willing, you will rise with utmost effort to fulfill what is befitting for the days of your Lord. Whatever has been manifested by you in the path of God and all that you have borne in His love are all recorded and witnessed. God willing, you will turn to what was revealed by the Supreme Pen in the first letter and remain steadfast in all circumstances. Hold fast to it.

O you who gaze upon the countenance, observe the creatures of the earth and consider what they say and do. By the life of the Beloved, they have not heard the blessed word, "There is no God but He," in the days of God, nor have they comprehended this station. They wander in the wilderness of illusions and are bewildered in the valley of conjectures. The people of the Bayán appear, in truth, like the people of the Qur'an; nay, they are even more veiled. The insightful among them perceive these souls as lower than animals. In all times, one must strive purely for the sake of the Most Merciful to educate humanity, freeing them entirely from doubts and illusions.

It is reported that various supplications from you were presented, and they expressed much favor, particularly in these days when the fragrance of discord has subsided, and the light of the sun of unity has shone forth from the horizons of hearts. As for what you wrote regarding Satan and his manifestations, it is abundantly clear and known that they, at all times, cling to the cord of falsehood and speak according to their own desires. Praise be to God, all matters are clear, and nothing is hidden.

It was apparent that the Most Great Beauty, outwardly compelled by government orders, journeyed toward Iraq. Subsequently, that deluded figure—after hiding for some time in the lands of Kermanshah and its environs—arrived. After leaving Iraq, he joined the group in Hadba. All companions who were present bear witness to these events, and all saw that, when presented before the countenance, he was incapable of speech.

Observe, if the hand of grace had not revealed these matters, how many souls would have drowned in the seas of their own illusions! Afterward, in the land of mystery, the Most Great Beauty withdrew from all and dwelt in a house where He remained veiled day and night for some time. These events were observed by seventy individuals. Despite this, he writes that he saw certain things he could not endure. "May the curse of God be upon the liars!" By this statement, he seeks to imply that He (the Most Great Beauty) left seclusion, while all are aware that the Most Great Beauty declared separation from him and his kind.

The Most Great Beauty dwelled in the house of Rida Bey in Adrianople, avoiding all interactions with others. When the circumstances unfolded and the distinction between the believer and the polytheist became evident, the matter returned to its original state. By God, Who is no other but Him, the hearts of the pure are aflame. This servant has stated that the first blow during the absence of the Most Great Beauty was when that perfidious oppressor desecrated the holy sanctuary of the Primal Point. Dissatisfied with his vile act, he handed it over to another wicked soul. We seek refuge in God from such abominable deeds.

When the Most Great Beauty graced those present with His return, He declared, “No heedless one has committed such an act.” Under such conditions, what can one say to people? For example, the mother of the Primal Point, may our souls be a sacrifice unto Him, confided to a devout woman that if they truly regarded Him (the Primal Point) as proof, why then did they violate His sanctity?

This matter, along with other vile actions of his, has been detailed by this servant in various contexts, all of which should be kept in mind. Convey these points to the heedless so they may be informed. Today, the Tablets revealed implicitly and explicitly to destroy the idols of doubts and illusions should be gathered so that all, upon observing them, may understand the malicious deeds of this lying heretic.

Indeed, several individuals appeared, such as Sayyid Muhammad Isfahani and Mirza Husayn Qummi, who busied themselves spreading falsehoods. Your eminence knows well that these souls had no knowledge of the original Cause and falsely claimed to have been aware of it from its inception. Truly, those who denied and disbelieved in the verses of God are among the losers.

For twelve years, this servant was with him (the disbeliever) at the command of the Most Great Beauty. He decreed the death of the third believer in Him Whom God shall make manifest. Despite this, he continues to make false claims. "May the curse of God be upon the oppressors!" If only a soul could witness his recent actions in Cyprus! This servant is ashamed to mention them.

Reflect on the deluded souls present in that land, who, despite their complete ignorance of this Cause, act and speak as they do. God willing, through the strength and power of steadfast souls, the fortress of the Cause will remain safeguarded from the wickedness of these deluded and vile individuals. Verily, He guides whomsoever He wills to His straight path.

If only those with insight would examine his writings, they would understand his station. He is indeed in manifest error. This day surpasses all mention of names and what has been said or will be said. This is the Day of God, and in it the sacred Tree proclaims, "There is no God but Him, the Truth." His traces are like dust, suitable only for those with bat-like tendencies, as they bring darkness and obscurity. God willing, at all times, with the assistance of the Almighty Beloved, you will serve as a herald, promoter, and elucidator of the Cause of God.

Convey greetings on behalf of this lowly servant to all the friends in that land. Mention to them that today is a new and wondrous day. God willing, the sanctified and pure souls will be adorned and beautified with the grandeur of supreme steadfastness. Say, "O gentlemen, what is expressed is for the sake of God. Hold firmly to the cord of unity in such a manner that the swords of the world will be incapable of severing it."

In the name of Truth, take one step higher so that you may observe all the people of the world as mere children playing with clay, and those who turn away from the Bayán as worms of the earth. God willing, in all circumstances, they will be free from all that is other than God, and their gaze will remain fixed upon the horizon of the One True Friend. Verily, He speaks the truth and guides to the path. Sovereignty belongs to God, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

As for what you mentioned concerning His Eminence, Tahmasquli Khan, it was presented to the sacred threshold. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur has uttered: He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High.

This is a mention from the oppressed one to the one who heard the call and turned toward the Most Exalted Horizon, that he may rejoice and be among those firmly established in this Cause, by which every foundation has been shaken, every mountain leveled, and every footstep faltered—save for those whom God, the Lord of the worlds, willed to be steadfast. The objects of existence have been set in motion by the clamor of My Supreme Pen. Yet the polytheists remain veiled, gazing upon the sun while denying its radiance, beholding the light yet questioning its existence. Thus have their souls deceived them. By My life, they are indeed among the losers.

Glad tidings to you for having attained to My mention in former days and in this very moment, wherein the tongue of the prisoner proclaims, "There is no God but I, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise." Take the Book of God with strength from Him, then recite it with spirit and joy. Therein, you will find yourself in evident delight. We have seen your approach and have turned toward you; We heard your call and answered you with this mighty Book. Blessed are the fingers that have occupied themselves with inscribing My verses, the tongue that has spoken My praise, the eye that has gazed upon My horizon, the heart that has been enkindled with My love, and the breast that has been illumined with My name, the Mighty, the Wondrous. Blessings be upon you and upon those who have attained this Cause.

This is the Cause by which the backs of all tyrants and heedless ones have been broken. It has concluded. As for what you mentioned regarding the friends in the lands of "S," "Sh," and "M," it was presented before the Throne. It was stated that the gaze of divine favor encompasses all and shall continue to do so. God willing, they will drink from the Fountain of the Most Merciful in such a manner that the hands of discord will be unable to seize it. In all circumstances, remind the friends of the Most Merciful not to be brought low by the autumnal winds. They have always been and will continue to be remembered in the presence of Truth, God willing.

From this station, declare their greatness and blessings upon their faces and upon all who stand firm. Gladden everyone with the bounties of God, for He is the best of Rememberers and the best of Helpers. Blessings be upon you, upon them, and upon those who have attained this mighty station.

Regarding the noble letters you sent to this lowly servant, responses have been provided. Two petitions written by the maidservants of God in that land and presented to the holy sanctuary were also received and delivered. They were shown the utmost favor. God willing, a reply will be granted to them as well.

As for what you wrote about the beloved, His Eminence Mirza Haydar-'Ali, may glory rest upon him, it was stated: “Verily, you have been faithful to your covenant and testament.” In recent days, this servant received a letter from him in which he requested several Tablets for certain individuals. All have been revealed, and God willing, they will be sent either in this instance or the next. However, the location must be observed, and the Tablet granted accordingly.

Truly, there is a need for a few elucidators, endowed with steadfastness, detachment, and eloquence, who will turn toward the people and engage in teaching with writings suitable to their conditions. They must encompass and permeate the world, just as has been repeatedly heard from the Tongue of your Lord, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.

Concerning His Eminence Jawad, who has ascended to God, God willing, whatever is appropriate will be revealed. Blessed is he in his life, and blessed is he after his passing.

Convey to all the friends the glad tidings of this perishing servant, that this is a day unlike any other. It is the Day of God, wherein all realities are summoned, and the divine Tree proclaims, “There is no God but Him, the Most High.” From Him proceeds every bounty, and with Him resides every authority. God willing, the sanctified and purified souls will be adorned and glorified with the mantle of supreme steadfastness.

Say: O friends, all that is conveyed is for the sake of God. Seize the cord of unity so firmly that no sword of the world can sever it. In the name of Truth, step forward with grandeur and ascend, so you may view all the peoples of the world as children engrossed in playing with clay and observe the deniers of the Bayán as worms. May you remain, in every moment, detached from all that is not of God and steadfast in gazing toward the countenance of the One True Friend.

Verily, He speaks the truth and guides to the straight path. Sovereignty belongs to God, the One, the Mighty, the Beautiful.

As for the mention of Tahmasquli Khan, it was presented to the sacred threshold. This is what the Tongue of Grandeur proclaimed: "He is the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High."
