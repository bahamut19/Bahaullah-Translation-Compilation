# Welcome! {#sec-welcome .unnumbered}

This book is a provisional translation of Baha'u'llah's Writings. All items are taken from the original Arabic and Persian from various sources and translated using the latest version of OpenAI's GPT.

There are thousands of works which have not been translated yet. Some of which had been translated, by authorized sources of the Baha'i Faith, others by academics and those interested in the revelation of Baha'u'llah.

We acknowledge GPT is imperfect, but we can acknowledge it is unbiased in that it was trained from many data points, some of which may favor a perspective, but the totality of all data points should bring the translation as close to a neutral voice as possible. We hope you find this book useful. You are welcome to share it as you see fit.
