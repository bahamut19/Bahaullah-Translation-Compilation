# Persian Bayán {#sec--persian-bayán .unnumbered}

This is what has been revealed by the Lord, the Exalted, the Most High:

*In the name of God, the Most Immaculate, the Most Sacred.*

## Introduction

1 Glorification and sanctification befit the sanctified court of the majesty of His might and the glory of His sovereignty, for He has eternally existed and shall forever exist by His own essence and being. He has eternally and shall forever remain exalted by His primordial loftiness, beyond the comprehension of all things.

2 He has not manifested the sign of His recognition in anything except through the inability of all things to comprehend Him. He has not revealed Himself unto any thing except by His own essence, for He has eternally been exalted above any association with things.

3 He has created all things in such a manner that all, through their innate reality, confess to Him on the Day of Resurrection that there is none like unto Him, nor any equal, nor any peer, nor any companion, nor any similitude. Rather, He has ever been singular in the sovereignty of His divinity and ever mighty in the majesty of His lordship.

4 No thing has truly known Him as He deserves to be known, nor is it possible for anything to truly know Him as He deserves to be known. This is because whatever is attributed to Him with the mention of "thingness" has been created by Him through the sovereignty of His will. He has manifested Himself through Himself in the loftiness of His station.

5 He has created the sign of His will in the innermost reality of all things so that they may attain certitude that He is the First and the Last, He is the Manifest and the Hidden. He is the Creator and the Provider. He is the Omnipotent and the All-Knowing. He is the All-Hearing. And He is the All-Seeing and the All-Hearing. He is the Subduer and the Self-Sustaining. He is the Giver of life and the Cause of death. He is the Omnipotent and the Inaccessible. He is the Exalted and the Most High.

6 He does not and will not signify anything except His own exaltation in glorification, His sublimity in sanctity, His inaccessibility in oneness, and His loftiness in greatness. He has no primacy except through His own primality, and He has no finality except through His own finality. Every thing that has been measured within Him or will be measured has become a "thing" through its "thingness" and has been realized through its "existence." By Him, God initiated the creation of all things, and unto Him, the creation of all things returns. He is the One to whom all the Most Beautiful Names belong and have always belonged.

7 The essence of His being is sanctified beyond every name and description, and His luminous reality transcends all loftiness and sublimity. His pure essence is sanctified from every restriction and elevation. He is the First, yet cannot be known through it. He is the Last, yet cannot be described through it. He is the Manifest, yet cannot be defined by it. He is the Hidden, yet cannot be comprehended by it.

8 He is the first to believe in *Him Whom God shall make manifest*, and He is the first to believe in the one who has been manifested. He is the unique reality through whom the creation of all things takes place. Through His provision, all things are sustained. Through His death, the death of all things is revealed. Through His life, the life of all things is manifested. Through His resurrection, the resurrection of all things is disclosed.

9 A Countenance has arisen, the like of which the eyes of existence have never beheld—neither before nor after this. This is the visage of divinity and the countenance of lordship, settled under the shadow of the face of God’s divinity, and signifying the sovereignty of oneness. Had it been known that the love of this Countenance could be tasted by all things, its mention would not have ceased. When it was not bowed to the essence of its being was created as it is and upon what it stands. Otherwise, nothing would experience the taste of its love.

10 Light upon light within light leading to light upon light: God guides to His light whomsoever He wills, and He elevates to His light whomever He desires. He is the Originator and the Restorer. He is the One God, the Singular, whose own self-manifestation has brought forth eighteen souls. These souls were created from His essence before all things, and He has established their recognition within the innermost reality of all things. This serves the purpose of enabling all beings to testify, through their own essence, that He is the One, the First, and the Ever-Living.

11 No decree has been issued for any contingent being except the recognition of His essence. This recognition sanctifies His being from all that is other than Him. At His command, all things are created, for to Him belong the creation and the command, from before and after. He is the Lord of all worlds.

12 It should not remain hidden from the observer of these words that God caused the Qur’án to return on the Day of Resurrection with the manifestation of His own essence within it. Thereafter, He brought all things into being anew. It was as though all things were created for the first time, for everything that has been created exists for the Day of the Manifestation of God. He is the One to whom all things turn and the One to whom all things ultimately return. When He appeared with the manifestation of His signs of power, there was no doubt that all things attained, to the utmost extent possible, the meeting with God.

13 Once again, God, exalted and glorious, created the Primal Will and, through it, brought forth all things. The mention of the creation of all things as a wondrous act serves as proof that His creation has eternally existed and shall forever exist. For when no contingent being existed, God was still God, and there was no creation to restore. Verily, God has always been in the loftiness of His sanctity. Whatever is beneath Him remains confined within the limits of its own proximity.

14 The first creation of all things occurred at this very moment, which is described as the Day of Friday. It has been decreed as a day of remembrance of God. The Lord of Might and Glory created this wondrous creation by His command and established it under His shadow until He returns it. There is no doubt that God originates this creation and then brings it back, and verily God is powerful over all things. The arrangement of the creation of all things has been made in accordance with the number of all things, through commandments revealed from His sanctified realm. These commandments have arisen as the dawning rays of His bountiful sun so that all things, through the remembrance of all things in all things, might attain perfection in preparation for the appearance of the final resurrection.

15 On that Day, every thing shall be recompensed with the reward of all things, whether it be through His justice for the self or through His grace for confirmations. His knowledge of all things before all things mirrors His knowledge of all things after all things, just as His power over all things before creation matches His power over all things after their creation. God has eternally been all-knowing of all things and omnipotent over all things. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names, from before and after. All who are in the heavens, on the earth, and between them glorify Him. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.

16 With the eye of certainty, observe that the gates of the religion of the Bayán are arranged according to the number of all things. Beneath the shadow of each gate, the angels of the heavens, the earth, and what lies between them are prostrate by the permission of God. They magnify, sanctify, glorify, and revere Him. They perform their duties and exalt Him. On the Day of the Manifestation of God, which is the appearance of the Point of the Bayán in its final state, all will return unto Him. Whenever all things return unto Him, even the souls of those who had refused, the fruits of all things shall be made manifest before Him. Blessed is the one who is gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the presence of God and who turns toward His countenance.

17 God has determined that each gate of the gates of all things serves as a reality unto itself. To it, all accounts return by virtue of the Bayán, according to what has been enacted in that gate. Hasten, then, to this, and hasten again, and yet again, and once more, and once more. This is because God is the swiftest of all reckoners. There may arise a situation where not all gates of all things present themselves before Him. In such a case, He will decree the return of the creation of the Bayán, and the heavens elevated in the Bayán will be folded in His grasp, just as the heavens of the Qur’án were encompassed before Him. Though the gates of the Qur’án were numerous and varied for the believers, when God brought forth the creation of the Qur’án to His light, they all became a single reality, a single gate from among the gates of remembrance. Thus does God do as He wills and ordains what He desires. He is not questioned about what He does, but all shall be questioned concerning all things.

18 At the moment when the entirety of the Qur’án is returned, and the beginning of the creation of all things within the Bayán takes place, the Point—manifesting lordship—shall stand upon the land named Basṭ. The heavens elevated in the Qur’án shall be folded entirely and return to the first Point. None shall bear witness to this except God and those near Him.

19 Although no matter was revealed in the Qur’án more momentous than the Day of Resurrection, God, the Reckoner, accounted for the total number of souls who adhered to the religion of the Qur’án. Upon their return, one soul from among all these souls stood in the presence of God. This soul became the return of all things, and the creation of all things in another dispensation was elevated by God’s command. Take heed, O people of the Bayán, to guard yourselves so that you do not veil yourselves from God, your Lord, while you claim by night and by day that you love Him or sanctify Him.

## Vahid 1

### Gate 1

1 In the first gate of the number of all things, God, exalted and glorified, has decreed as an obligation the word: *"There is no God but God, truly, truly."*

2 All of the Bayán will return to this word, and the spreading forth of the final creation will arise from it. The recognition of this word is dependent on the recognition of the Point of the Bayán, whom God has made the essence of the Seven Letters within it.

3 Whoever attains certainty that it is the Point of the Qur’án in its finality and the Point of the Bayán in its beginning, and that it is the Primal Will, self-sustaining, and through which all things are created by its command and sustained by it, has attained true faith.

4 Its essence bears witness to the oneness of its Lord. Whoever does not believe in it shall be cast into the fire. And what fire is greater than that for one who does not believe in it? Conversely, whoever believes in it shall enter affirmation. And what paradise is loftier than that for one who believes in it?

5 This is the word that has been exalted, magnified, glorified, sanctified, and extolled by its Lord morning and evening. Regard this word as you would regard the sun in the sky. Look upon one who believes in it as you would look upon a mirror, for every believer in the essence of the Seven Letters derives their being from one of the names of God, exalted and glorified.

6 Externally, such a one is a leaf from the Tree of Affirmation. All things return to this one reality, and all things are created through this one reality. This singular reality, on the Day of Resurrection, is none other than *Him Whom God shall make manifest*, who declares in every instance: *"I am God. There is no God but Me, the Lord of all things. All besides Me are My creation. O My creation, worship Me."*

7 He is the mirror of God through whom the mirror of dominion is manifested, composed of the Living Letters. Nothing can be seen within Him but God. Whoever in the Bayán utters the word *"There is no God but God"* is thereby directed toward God.

8 Just as creation begins with Him, so too does creation return to Him. The purpose of this world is that, at the time of the appearance of *Him Whom God shall make manifest*, people do not claim, “We say There is no God but God and that is the essence of religion.” This is because what they say is but a reflection of His sun, which was manifested during His first appearance. He is more deserving of this word than all the essences of creation, through His very self.

9 The mirror declares, “The sun is within me,” but before the sun, it is evident that the mirror reflects its light. He proclaims: *"We have known you, O people of the Bayán! The loftiness of your existence lies in the word of your Lord. Do not veil yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, in truth. For what you speak within your hearts is like His appearance in your innermost beings, and what He speaks is what God has borne witness to of Himself—that there is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting."*

10 Today, any soul that utters this word, the essence of all religion, undoubtedly speaks in the voice of Muhammad, the Messenger of God—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him and His family—of the past. The sun of this word has been within their hearts, and what manifests from them today is but a reflection of it. Thus, in His next appearance, He will return to them, in the appearance of the Point of the Bayán, not in His first manifestation.

11 During His first manifestation, the tree of oneness had not yet been elevated within the essences of creation. Now, after one thousand two hundred and seventy years, this tree has reached the stage of bearing fruit. Whoever is within it is but a reflection of the sun of the Point of the Criterion (*furqán*), which is identical to the Point of the Bayán. Before Him, this must necessarily become apparent.

12 An example is set forth in the supreme word, upon which the entirety of religion is established. Through its utterance, the foundation of all religion is confirmed. In the hour of death, all will speak this word and return to Him.

13 The reflections within mirrors inevitably return to their origin. When the mirrors reflect the image of the sun, they return to it, for their existence began with it. The mirrors' purpose lies solely in their capacity as mirrors, reflecting the sun from which they originated. The exaltation of the Word of the *Furqán* in the past, and the exaltation of the Word of the Bayán in the future, reflect a similar pattern relative to the Sun of Truth.

14 Consider the various aspects arising from this Word, such as the knowledge of the names of God, the recognition of the Prophet, the recognition of the Imáms of guidance, the gates of guidance, and the innumerable branches of subsidiary matters.

15 Each soul that becomes veiled by one of these aspects is thereby separated from the reality of its own existence, which originated from God and will ultimately return to Him, provided it stems from the Tree of Affirmation.

16 The sign of its oneness should testify to the Sun. If, God forbid, it does not testify to the Sun, it is unworthy of mention. Consider the souls that associate themselves with the Qur’án. How much of their judgment contradicts what God has revealed, as evidenced by their actions. These contradictions pertain to their essence, not the branches arising from their essence.

17 That which branches into what is less than the truth reverts to its essence. If its essence does not testify to God, it is not worthy of mention before Him. However, that which branches from true essences will ultimately return to those essences. If these essences are steadfast signs, residing firmly within the mirrors of their hearts rather than merely being transient, they will return to their proper stations both in origin and in return.

18 As the sun has eternally shone forth, these mirrors eternally bear witness. The bounty of God has never been withheld or exhausted in any circumstance. Blessed is the one who declares: *"God is my Lord, and I associate no partner with Him in His Lordship."*

19 Verily, the essence of the Seven Letters is the gate of God. I shall not invoke any gate alongside Him, and whoever believes in *Him Whom God shall make manifest* attains thereby the first gate of the One, the First. Blessed are those who succeed on this great day. This is the day when all are presented before God, their Lord,

### Gate 2

1 The essence of this gate is that Muhammad—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him—and the manifestations of His own self returned to this world.

2 They were the first of His servants to be present in the presence of God on the Day of Resurrection, acknowledging His oneness and delivering the signs of His gate to all. God fulfilled His promise, as stated in the Qur’án: *"And We desired to show favor to those who were oppressed in the land and to make them leaders and to make them inheritors."*

3 He made them Imáms. The same reasoning that establishes the prophethood of Muhammad—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him—is evident in their return to this world before God and the learned ones. This is proven by the signs of God, which no one on earth can imitate, for they are utterly incapable of producing anything comparable.

4 There is no doubt that the nobility of a servant lies in affirming the oneness of God, recognizing Him, acknowledging His justice, obeying Him, and being content with His will. Similarly, there is no doubt that these sanctified souls attained the essence of all loftiness and glory before any other soul.

5 Every living being that imagines honor finds it only through the good pleasure of God. There is no doubt that they were the first lights to bow before God, accepting the signs that He revealed through His gate and conveying them.

6 There exists no loftier station in the realm of possibility than this: that the heart of a servant bears witness to God.

7 No one should remain veiled from their Beloved to the extent of nineteen times nine. Every soul, in whatever it undertakes during its life, wills nothing but the good pleasure of God. This is the ultimate aim of all.

8 There is no doubt that the good pleasure of God is only made manifest through the pleasure of one upon whom God has conferred His proof. It is certain that these sanctified lights attained the good pleasure of God before all things. This is the loftiest elevation above every loftiness and the most sublime distinction above all other distinctions.

9 It is beyond doubt that their return in the final manifestation is greater in the sight of God than their initial appearance. Just as prophethood was established in the past, today guardianship (*wiláyah*) is established.

10 Even though the appearance of the Point of the Bayán is identical to the appearance of Muhammad, their return is also the same. However, through the manifestation of God, all names exist under His shadow and testify to Him.

11 He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. God has set apart their names during this cycle as the Living Letters (*ḥurúf-i-ḥayy*).

12 This refers to the fourteen sanctified souls and the hidden and preserved name, which is associated with the Four Gates, the Lights of the Throne, or the Bearers of Creation, Sustenance, Death, and Life.

13 These collectively amount to the number of *ḥayy* (18), representing the closest names to God. Everything besides them is guided through their guidance. God began the creation of the Bayán with them, and He will cause the return of the creation of the Bayán through them.

14 They are lights that have eternally existed. They have eternally been and will continue to be prostrate before the Throne of Truth.

15 In every manifestation, they have been mentioned by a particular name among the people. With each appearance, their physical names may have changed, yet their essential names, which signify God and manifest within their hearts, remain constant.

16 Without the nearness of their essence, they could not have stood in the presence of God, who has eternally existed and will forever exist.

17 God has names beyond limit, yet all are revealed through these names. Just as the guidance of all depends on their guidance, in the hearts of these names nothing is seen but God.

18 Indeed, within the heart of any believing soul, whether male or female, there is no vision but that of the name upon which their heart depends, granted by God. Within them, nothing is perceived except: *"He is God, the One. To Him belong creation and command, from before and after. There is no God but Him, the Living, the Self-Subsisting."*

19 Every soul that believed in Muhammad, peace be upon Him, or in anyone before Him, has returned under His shadow. *"And each shall be recompensed for what they have earned, and God is witness over all things."*

### Gate 3

This pertains to ‘Alí, upon Him be peace, who returned to this world with those who believed in Him and those beneath them. He is the second to believe in the Point after Sín (\*the letter "S").

### Gate 4

This pertains to Fáṭimah, peace be upon her, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in her and those beneath her.

### Gate 5

This pertains to Ḥasan, upon Him be peace, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 6

This pertains to Ḥusayn, upon Him be peace, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 7

This pertains to ʿAlí ibn al-Ḥusayn, peace be upon Him, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 8

This pertains to Muḥammad ibn ʿAlí, peace be upon Them, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### **Gate 9**

This pertains to Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad, peace be upon Them, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 10

This pertains to Músá ibn Jaʿfar, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 11

This pertains to ʿAlí ibn Músá, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 12

This pertains to Muḥammad ibn ʿAlí, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 13

This pertains to ʿAlí ibn Muḥammad, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 14

This pertains to Ḥasan ibn ʿAlí, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 15

1 This pertains to the appearance of the Ḥujjat, peace be upon Him, through the signs and clear evidences in the manifestation of the Point of the Bayán, which is identical to the manifestation of the Furqán. Although the Point of the Bayán appeared first and the Point of the Furqán appeared second, the manifestation of the Hujjat occurred in the Fifteenth Gate.

2 The wisdom behind this lies in the fact that the Point, in its state of abstraction, represents the pure manifestation of God. In the station of divinity (*ulūhiyyat*), it is manifest in the first position mentioned. In the station of determination, which is the primal will (*mashiyyat awliyyah*), it is mentioned in the second position. In the station of upholding all souls, which is specific to the Fourteenth Manifestation, it is mentioned in the Fifteenth Gate.

3 The Point, in its station of primality, has eternally existed and will forever remain. It is most deserving of embodying all names from the essence of the names themselves. For example, when the name of divinity is mentioned, the name of lordship is also present, along with all other names. Despite this, it is always manifest under the name of divinity in the station of the Point.

4 The examples of all names, in their exalted realities, appear from Him: *"He is the First when He is the Last, and He is the Hidden when He is the Manifest. He is the One who is mentioned by every name at the time when He is not mentioned by any but the name: There is no God but Him, the Self-Subsisting Sustainer."*

### Gate 16

This pertains to the return of the First Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

### Gate 17

This pertains to the return of the Second Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

### Gate 18

This pertains to the return of the Third Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

### Gate 19

This pertains to the return of the Fourth Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

## Vahid 2

### Gate 1

#### 1

This explains the recognition of the Proof (*ḥujjat*) and the Evidence (*dalīl*).

The summary of this gate is as follows: God, exalted be His glory, in every cycle sends forth a proof corresponding to the highest station of loftiness by which the people of that cycle take pride. For instance, during the time of the Qur’án’s revelation, the pride of all people lay in the eloquence of speech. Therefore, God revealed the Qur’án with the utmost loftiness of eloquence and established it as the miracle of the Messenger of God, peace be upon Him. In the Qur’án, God affirmed the truth of the Messenger of God and the religion of Islam through its verses, which are the greatest of evidences.

The greatness of this proof lies in the fact that all speak through alphabetical letters, yet God revealed the words of the Qur’án in such a manner that if all who are upon the earth were to gather and attempt to produce a single verse comparable to those of the Qur’án, they would be unable. All would be rendered powerless.

The secret of this lies in the fact that God revealed the Qur’án from the Tree of Will (*mashiyyat*), which is the Muhammadan reality, in the language of the Prophet Himself. That Tree, being inaccessible, reveals no letter except that it draws forth the spirit of the thing upon its descent.

For example, if it is revealed: *"We have initiated this creation as a command from Us, established over all things."* When the term "initiation" is mentioned, it encompasses everything that is associated with the name of all things. This is because none but God encompasses all things, and only His word can transcend and dominate over all things. Through His utterance, all creation begins.

Similarly, if God reveals: *"And indeed, We worship this creation as a promise from Us; verily, We have power over all things."*

#### 2

At the moment of the descent of this word, it takes hold of the spirits of all things and causes their return within the manifestation of this verse. This ensures that, on the Day of Resurrection, all things shall be present before God, confirming the truth of their return.

None but God is capable of this, for whatever God speaks emanates from the Tree of Reality itself. Through it, the essence of a thing is created.

If something lies below the station of *ʿIlliyyīn* (the exalted ones), it is negated from the Letters of Affirmation. Conversely, if it is from the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, it is affirmed as part of them. This is because the word of God is truth, and in everything where it is revealed, the essence of that thing becomes attached to it so that it may testify to its truth.

Thus, it has already been revealed: *“The fire is true, and paradise is true.”* The act of creation and the spirit of the Word are established as truth in their respective stations. Any soul that contemplates this will certainly observe that the spirits of truth are embodied through the manifestation of the primal Point in the signs of God within the realities of souls and the horizons.

As God previously mentioned in the Qur’án: *"We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth."*

Until one perceives the essence of all things, which is the spirit of their heart, they cannot comprehend the realization that *“The word of God is truth.”* It is not merely through verbal mention that the realization of truth occurs within the essence of a thing. This reality is unique to God, exalted and glorified. None but Him is the creator of things, the provider of things, the one who causes their death, and the one who brings them to life.

Every word that is affirmed or negated in His dominion occurs within the shadow of that which He has revealed through His signs. In reality, these words themselves are nothing other than what manifests through the appearances of the signs of God and His words.

For when God mentions a believer, the creation of that believer is brought into being. Similarly, when He reveals something as being below the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, the spirits of that entity are created in accordance with it. This is the secret of why the signs of God are a proof over all creation and the greatest of evidences.

The clear evidences (*bayyinát*) and the most magnificent manifestations are proofs of His power and knowledge. There is no doubt that during the cycle of the Point of the Bayán, the pride of the people of understanding (*ulú'l-albáb*) was in the knowledge of oneness, the subtleties of understanding, and the inaccessible realities recognized by those with true insight.

#### 3

For this reason, God placed the knowledge of His proof, like the proof of the Messenger of God, within the very essence of His verses. He caused words to flow from His tongue at the height of oneness and the loftiness of abstraction, such that every soul possessing the spirit of oneness humbly submitted to Him, except for those who failed to comprehend what He spoke to His Beloved.

From Him emanated countless expressions of wisdom and knowledge, which none but God has understood or recognized. Even though the manifestation of the Sun of Truth itself inspires all contingent beings to comprehend His loftiness, it is through the verses and words bestowed upon Him by God that He has drawn all existences to the radiance of His signs. *“He has no equal by which He may be known, no peer by which He may be described, no likeness by which He may be compared, no partner with whom He may be associated, nor any similitude by which He may be likened. Exalted is God far above all such comparisons, supremely glorified!”*

In Him, nothing is seen but God, and indeed, all are devoted worshippers before Him. During this cycle, God has bestowed upon the Point of the Bayán His verses and clear evidences, making Him an impenetrable proof against all things. Even if all who dwell upon the earth were to gather, they could not produce a single verse comparable to those which God caused to flow from His tongue.

#### 4

Any soul that contemplates these verses with certainty observes that they are beyond human capacity. These verses are exclusively from God, the One, the Absolute. God has caused His words to flow from the tongue of whomever He wills and will not cause them to flow except from the Point of Will (*mashiyyat*). He is the sender of all messengers and the revealer of all scriptures.

If this matter had been within human capacity, someone should have been able to produce verses comparable to the Qur’án during the 1,270 years from its revelation to the revelation of the Bayán. However, despite the loftiness of their power, all who attempted to extinguish the Word of God failed utterly.

Even today, if anyone examines the time from the initial revelation of the Bayán until now, they will surely observe that those who acknowledged the proof of its verses and proclaimed them to all were indeed the proofs (*ḥujjaj*) of God. Even if their proof had not been outwardly evident, their spiritual exaltation and insight were undeniable.

The lowest of the disciples of the late, exalted Sayyid—the Exalted One (*Siyyid-i-A‘lá*)—surpassed in wisdom and understanding the scholars and sages of the earth. Among those who have affirmed the proof of the verses, whether from this community or others, there has never been any doubt concerning their elevated piety.

#### 5

Though this statement is made in recognition of the weakness of people’s comprehension, it remains true that the testimony of God outweighs that of all who are upon the earth. There is no doubt that the testimony of God is only made manifest through the testimony of one whom He has appointed as His proof.

The self-evident nature of the verses is sufficient as testimony, rendering all who dwell upon the earth powerless before them. These verses are a lasting proof from God until the Day of Resurrection. If anyone reflects on the manifestation of this Tree of Will, they will undoubtedly affirm the loftiness of the Cause of God. Consider that this revelation emanates from a soul only 24 years of age, who was devoid of any formal training in the sciences learned by others. Despite this, the verses are recited with such fluency and clarity, without contemplation or hesitation.

In just five hours, he composes a thousand verses in supplication, without the pen ceasing. Interpretations and profound scientific insights emerge from him, demonstrating exalted stations of understanding and oneness that surpass the grasp of all scholars and sages. All who encounter such works admit their inability to comprehend them fully.

#### 6

There is no doubt that all of this originates from God. Scholars who have labored their entire lives in study and effort struggle to compose even a single line of eloquent Arabic, often concluding with words unworthy of mention. All of this is a proof intended for creation, for the Cause of God is too exalted and majestic to be known except through Him.

Indeed, it is through Him that others are known, not the reverse. By the essence of the one true God, whose existence is singular and eternal, the signs of this revelation are brighter than the light of the sun at midday. The effects of those who have been guided by Him, even if they ascend to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding, resemble the light of stars in the night compared to the brightness of His guidance.

May God forgive such comparisons. How can the ocean of eternity be grasped by the sea of contingency? How can the remembrance of the primordial be likened to the remembrance of limitations?

*Glorified and exalted is God above all that is mentioned by earthly and heavenly allusions.*

#### 7

All that has been described pertains to the limited realms of creation. However, this is exactly how the argument unfolds in this Resurrection, just as God previously questioned through His own tongue: *“Whose book is the Qur’án?”* All the believers responded: *“It is the Book of God.”*

God then asked: *“Is there any difference between the Furqán and the Bayán?”* The hearts replied: *“No, by God! All is from our Lord, and none will take heed except those endowed with insight.”*

God then revealed: *“That was My word through the tongue of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, peace be upon Him. This is My word through the tongue of the Essence of the Seven Letters, the Gate of God, peace be upon Him.”*

Whoever believes in it has no refuge if they wish to remain steadfast in their faith except to believe in these verses. Otherwise, their essence will be rendered void, and their deeds will become as though they were nothing, unmentioned and forgotten.

#### 8

God then revealed: \*“O My creation! All of you, from the beginning of your lives to their end, strive with utmost effort to earn My good pleasure. If you act upon any secondary matter, it is because I have revealed it in My Book. If you believe in the Imáms of guidance or seek nearness to Me through visiting their graves, it is because their celestial status has been alluded to in the Qur’án. If you acknowledge the prophethood of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, it is because He is My Messenger. If you circumambulate around the Kaʿbah, it is because I have called it My house. If you revere the Qur’án, it is because it is My word.”\*

Indeed, upon every soul—even if it belongs to the nation of Adam—whatever one does is based on their relationship to Me, as they perceive it within themselves. However, they remain veiled, holding false assumptions and failing to recognize the realities of subsequent manifestations of My Cause. There is nothing whose judgment does not return to this human form, which has been created by My command.

This form returns degree by degree until it reaches My Prophet. The prophethood of My Prophet is not established except through the Book revealed to Him and the proof granted to Him. Today, which is the Day of My Manifestation, I have appeared in My very self. This utterance is like the mention of the Kaʿbah, which I have called My House.

#### 9

In reality, for My essence, there is neither a beginning nor an end, neither manifestation nor concealment. Today, whatever returns to this self, which recites My verses, returns to Me. Whatever does not return to Him does not return to Me. This is My manifestation in My very self and My concealment in My very essence, for this possible reality cannot exist in possibility itself. No station higher than this can be conceived in the Bayán.

How greatly veiled you are, O people, imagining that all your actions in your respective positions are for My good pleasure. Yet the verse that signifies Me and the signs of My power, whose treasures reside in His innate being, are recited by My permission. Despite this, you have confined Him unjustly to a mountain that none of its inhabitants is worthy of mention. Before Him, who is with Me, there exists none but a single soul, one of the Living Letters of My Book. Before Him, who stands in My presence, My hand bears witness, and no single lamp of light suffices as proof. However, in the positions reached through the progression of degrees, numerous lamps shine brightly. All upon the earth, created for Him, are sustained by His radiance, yet remain veiled from Him to the extent of a single lamp.

On this day, I bear witness to My creation, and apart from My testimony, nothing holds any value before Me. No paradise is greater for My creation than being in the presence of My very self and believing in My verses. Similarly, no fire is more severe than the veiling of these souls from the Manifestation of My self and their rejection of My verses.

#### 10

You claim to act on My behalf, yet how does this benefit you? Do you not see My verses confirming what you previously claimed in My Book? Even now, you feel no shame, despite witnessing that My Book is firmly established and all who believe in it believe in Me. Soon, you will see that your pride will be in your faith in these verses. Yet today, what benefits your souls is proclaiming belief in what does not benefit you and veils you from My cause, bringing harm to yourselves.

No harm has reached or will reach the Manifestation of My self. Whatever harm has occurred or will occur returns to your own souls. Show compassion for yourselves, and do not ascend in the air of imagined satisfaction of My will while veiling yourselves from the truth of My good pleasure.

#### 11

My good pleasure is manifest through the proof by which the religion of all is established. Yet, you remain veiled from it, even as you associate yourselves with the Qur’án. By My sanctified essence, no paradise for this creation is loftier than the manifestation.

There is no paradise greater than union with Me and My verses, and no fire more severe than being veiled from Me and My verses. If you claim that your inability is not evident to you, then journey throughout the east and west of the earth. Yet, this statement is meaningless, for today the truth of all upon the earth is connected to the Dispensation of Islam.

If the eloquent ones of this Dispensation are unable to produce the like of these verses, it is evidence that all are powerless. If they claim they are not powerless, why do they not produce a verse similar to My verses, born of innate reality rather than acquired knowledge or theft?

#### 12

In every age, before the truth, even those like the sorcerers of Moses’ time demonstrated what was within their capacity. Praise be to God that, from the time of My manifestation to today, even such demonstrations have not appeared from the scholars of this Dispensation. They falsely claim to ascend toward the loftiness of God's satisfaction while remaining veiled from the true Manifestation of His power.

This alone suffices as the abasement of the scholars of Islam. They claim knowledge of Islam and promote its teachings while veiling themselves from Him whose word establishes Islam. If they were merely content with their own veiling and refrained from wronging others or judging contrary to what was revealed in the Qur’án, their fate would still be the fire of their own deeds.

#### 13

However, they have worsened their condition and that of those who regard them as scholars of Islam. Indeed, whoever is veiled from the manifestation of God faces their own punishment. If they were to reflect upon the verses of God, they would observe their own incapacity. In that moment, neither rulership nor Islam and those under its shadow would not have been content with veiling themselves from the truth. The pride of all lies in following the truth. If their actions had not been ambiguous to themselves, matters would not have reached this point. There is no doubt that God will manifest His truth to all through His proof, as He does even today.

If anyone who associates themselves with Islam—whether from among those in positions of authority or those considered scholars—wishes to affirm the proof of these verses, it would be achieved in less than the blink of an eye. If they possess power, they could summon all the scholars and say to them, "Through your judgments, you have caused veiling from the one who possesses the verses."

The matter can only take one of two forms: either they themselves have brought forth a book and its verses are present, or they have not. If they have not, this verse, written here, is sufficient:

*"Glorified are You, O God! You are the Sovereign of sovereigns. You bestow sovereignty upon whomever You will and remove it from whomever You will. You exalt whomever You will and abase whomever You will. You grant victory to whomever You will and forsake whomever You will. You enrich whomever You will and impoverish whomever You will. You manifest whomever You will over whomever You will. In Your grasp is the dominion of all things. You create what You will by Your command. Verily, You are all-knowing, omnipotent, and powerful."*

#### 14

Speak in the manner He has spoken, naturally and innately. Write in the manner He has written, without pause or hesitation. If you cannot, it is proof that your deeds have been carried out without truth, and the bearer of these verses is the Truth, sent from God, and there is no doubt that God has revealed these verses upon him just as He revealed upon the Messenger of God. Today, the amount of verses resembling these totals over a hundred thousand verses, in addition to his scrolls of supplications and his scientific and wisdom-filled compositions.

In just five hours, a thousand verses emanate from him, or as quickly as a scribe is able to transcribe them. He recites the verses of God. This makes it possible to estimate that, had his works been freely disseminated from the beginning of the manifestation until today, an unimaginable quantity of works would have been spread among the people.

If you claim that these verses are not sufficient proofs in themselves, consider the Qur’án. Did God, in proving the prophethood of the Messenger of God—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him and His family—use anything other than His verses as proof? Reflect upon this.

#### 15

God has revealed:

*"None disputes concerning the signs of God except those who disbelieve, so do not let their movement through the land deceive you. Those before them, like the people of Noah, rejected the truth, and every nation sought to seize their messenger. They disputed with falsehood to invalidate the truth, but I seized them, and how severe was My punishment! Thus, the decree of your Lord is fulfilled upon those who disbelieve, that they are the companions of the Fire."*

In affirming the sufficiency of the Book, God has revealed:

*"Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book, recited to them? Indeed, in that is a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe."*

When God Himself testifies to the sufficiency of the Book through its own verses, how can anyone claim otherwise? One cannot deny the sufficiency of the Book as proof. If someone repeats what the first objectors said, their stance falls into one of two categories: either their intent is to reject the truth outright—which brings them no benefit, as God has revealed:

*"Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it."*

And elsewhere:

*"Indeed, those upon whom the decree of your Lord has been fulfilled will not believe, even if every sign comes to them, until they see the painful punishment."*

Alternatively, their intent may be to act cautiously in matters of religion. If this is the case, the understanding is straightforward:

*"In what discourse, after God and His signs, will they believe?"*

#### 16

They can either present themselves and inquire about their concerns in the manner of the verses, listening directly to what is recited—verses free from contemplation, formulation, or synthesis—or they can send someone to sit briefly in His presence, record what is recited from the verses of God, and reflect on them. They would then realize that these words are not the product of thought, combination, or contrivance.

If such a process were possible, it would have occurred with the Qur’án from the beginning of Islam until today. Similarly, since the onset of this Cause until now, no one has been able to produce anything comparable through such means. If objections are raised about the Arabic grammar or pronunciation within the recitation, such criticisms are invalid. This is because grammatical rules are derived from the verses themselves, not the other way around. There is no doubt that the bearer of the verses disclaims these rules and the associated knowledge for himself.

#### 17

In truth, the lack of adherence to these rules, while presenting verses of this nature and such words, holds no bearing for those of understanding (*ulú'l-albáb*). There is no greater accomplishment than understanding the Book of God, for the purpose of knowledge is to comprehend His Book. The Tree upon which the Book of God is revealed does not require knowledge of these sciences. Rather, all grammatical rules and expressions are derived from what God has revealed and are established upon it.

Many individuals possess extensive knowledge of these sciences, yet their faith in the verses of God is firmly established. This is because the purpose of knowledge is to understand the commands of God and follow His good pleasure, not to remain distant from them. If these sciences themselves bore fruit, the learned ones of Arabia would have surpassed the non-Arabs in their spiritual station. However, true honor lies not in these sciences but in the good pleasure of God, knowledge of His oneness, and abiding in the shadow of obedience to Him and satisfaction with Him.

There is no doubt that most actions performed between individuals and God are intended to seek His good pleasure. Yet, few truly comprehend His good pleasure unless they discern the pleasure of His proof. Today, the good pleasure of God is inseparable from the good pleasure of His proof and those who dwell under His shadow. Even though others may consider themselves rightly guided, only what God testifies to remains enduring. The deeds of those who do not follow the command of God will perish.

#### 18

Just as the rejection of the Qur’án by certain figures—such as Christian monks and the eloquent of the Arabs—was remembered in the early days of Islam, so too will the veiling of people today be remembered. Today, there is no action more beneficial for a servant than to examine the verses of the Bayán with fairness, observing the truth of the truth with absolute certainty. Through this, they may recognize the manifestation of meeting with Him is the meeting with God, and His good pleasure is the good pleasure of God. None should remain veiled, for all were created for this purpose, as God has revealed:

*"It is God who raised the heavens without pillars you see, then established Himself upon the Throne. He subjected the sun and the moon, each running for a specified term. He manages the affair, explains the signs, so that you may attain certainty in the meeting with your Lord."*

There is no doubt that any mirror turning toward the sun becomes illuminated by it. Without this, the sun itself rises and sets without affecting the mirror. The honor of all creation lies in attaining the fruit of their existence: the meeting with God and belief in His verses. Without this, the very existence of a thing becomes void. This is the same tree that planted the Qur’án within the hearts of the people for the sake of today. Today, all take pride and exalt themselves in relation to it and act accordingly.

#### 19

This is the meaning of *"There is no power and no strength except in God"* in the realm of divine legislation. If they were to remove the unfounded claims of association with Him, they would not possess even the strength of a fly. This abasement alone is sufficient for those who are veiled, as they claim association with Him yet act as they do. Instead of supporting Him as the fruit of their existence and His victory today, they neither support Him nor even accept being neutral. Were they content with neutrality, this Tree would not have been confined to this mountain.

God suffices as the ultimate judge over all His servants. He will judge with justice, and His judgment is manifest in these very words. This judgment will distinguish, until the Day of Resurrection, between those who turn toward Him and those who do not. All matters of divine decree He is the best of helpers, the best of protectors, the best of reckoners, and the best of judges.

### Gate 2

1 None can encompass the knowledge of what God has revealed in the Bayán except those whom God wills.

2 The essence of this gate is that no one can fully comprehend what God has revealed in the Bayán except *Him Whom God shall make manifest* or those to whom He grants knowledge.

3 This resembles the tree from which the Bayán has sprung. Even if all the oceans of the heavens and the earth were turned into ink, all things became pens, and all souls were made to record, they could not interpret a single letter of the Bayán as it truly is.

4 God has not given any letter of the Bayán a beginning or an end.

5 None is permitted to interpret what God has revealed in the Bayán except the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* under the shadow of *Him Whom God shall make manifest* and the Letters of the Living. All other letters beneath *ʿIlliyyīn* belong to the gates of the fire.

6 The Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* will be gathered under His shadow, while all other letters will be gathered under the shadow of negation. The past is as the future, and there is no change in the decree of God, just as the "before" of the past is as the "after" of the future.

7 The Qur’án comprises 114 surahs, with every six surahs corresponding to the exalted station of each letter of *Bismilláh al-Raḥmán al-Raḥím* ("In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate"). The first six surahs are associated with the *Bá’*, and the last six surahs are associated with the *Mím*.

8 All the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* are connected to the manifestations of the 19, while the gates of the fire are connected to the First Gate. Similarly, all the gates of paradise return to the First Gate. Ultimately, everything is encompassed in the phrase:

*"There is no God but God."*

9 All that lies beneath the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* is gathered under negation, while all that pertains to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* is gathered under affirmation. All the Letters beneath *ʿIlliyyīn* in the Qur’án are subsumed under the shadow of the First Gate of the fire and pass away.

10 In contrast, all the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* in the Qur’án remain under the shadow of the Word of Affirmation. *“Thus does God enrich whomsoever He wills and preserve whomsoever He desires. Verily, He is powerful, mighty, and capable.”*

11 It is impermissible to interpret the Bayán except through what has been interpreted by its Tree. All the names of His goodness are manifest in the radiance of the hearts of His believers. Likewise, all the letters beneath His *ʿIlliyyīn* are reflected in the realities of those who are not believers in Him.

Eternally, the Bayán is like the human soul, alive, with all its Letters of Light and Fire apparent in the horizons and within the souls. Today, anyone wishing to discern can do so, as this is the Day of the Manifestation of God, the Mighty. However, after the Tree is lifted, no one will have the capacity to discern the true reality except according to the apparent judgments of those who remain within the bounds of God.

Whoever adheres to these bounds belongs to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, while whoever transgresses them is beneath them—unless God, through His manifestation on the Day of Resurrection, resolves this creation.

At that time, the judgments of the Point of the Bayán at its final stage will reflect the judgments of its initial reality. Whoever believes in it belongs to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, while whoever does not believe in it is beneath them. God will distinguish between them with justice, for He is the best of judges.

The matter will reach the point where no mention of the Letters beneath *ʿIlliyyīn* remains except in the Book. That same Tree of Negation will recognize its own negation in comparison to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* and, unknowingly, curse itself until the sun of truth rises again.

At that time, their lack of faith will become evident, just as all who have witnessed this Resurrection have observed this matter with certainty. Although they claim today to believe in God and the verses of the Qur’án, the Tree of Reality, upon which the Qur’án descended, resides in this mountain with a single soul.

In the appearance of the Sun of Truth, realities are unveiled, and veils are removed. Those souls who never conceived anything less than the good pleasure of God have given judgments contrary to divine satisfaction—judgments that the pen hesitates to record—while the true pleasure of God is only revealed through the good pleasure of His Manifestation.

*“Take heed, O people of insight, and guard yourselves against disobeying the command of God.”*

### Gate 3

**The Third Gate of the One, the Second**: This pertains to the truth that within the Bayán lies the decree for all things.

The essence of this gate is that God has established two proofs upon all people: the verses of God and the soul upon whom these verses are revealed. The first proof is an enduring and apparent one, lasting until the Day of Resurrection. The second proof is manifest until the time of His concealment, at which point it becomes a hidden proof over all things, unknown to anyone.

For Him, there are witnesses who bear testimony from the moment of His concealment. These witnesses are superior to the enduring proof, which is the Bayán. They act as proof through His word, which He reveals until the Day of His Manifestation.

If, at the time of His manifestation, they become veiled from the one who has made them proofs, their condition will resemble the current scholars who, despite the words of one of the Imáms, peace be upon them—*“Look to those who transmit our traditions”*—have veiled themselves from...
