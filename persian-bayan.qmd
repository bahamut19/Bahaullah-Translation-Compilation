# Persian Bayán {#sec--persian-bayán .unnumbered}

This is what has been revealed by the Lord, the Exalted, the Most High:

*In the name of God, the Most Immaculate, the Most Sacred.*

## Introduction

1 Glorification and sanctification befit the sanctified court of the majesty of His might and the glory of His sovereignty, for He has eternally existed and shall forever exist by His own essence and being. He has eternally and shall forever remain exalted by His primordial loftiness, beyond the comprehension of all things.

2 He has not manifested the sign of His recognition in anything except through the inability of all things to comprehend Him. He has not revealed Himself unto any thing except by His own essence, for He has eternally been exalted above any association with things.

3 He has created all things in such a manner that all, through their innate reality, confess to Him on the Day of Resurrection that there is none like unto Him, nor any equal, nor any peer, nor any companion, nor any similitude. Rather, He has ever been singular in the sovereignty of His divinity and ever mighty in the majesty of His lordship.

4 No thing has truly known Him as He deserves to be known, nor is it possible for anything to truly know Him as He deserves to be known. This is because whatever is attributed to Him with the mention of "thingness" has been created by Him through the sovereignty of His will. He has manifested Himself through Himself in the loftiness of His station.

5 He has created the sign of His will in the innermost reality of all things so that they may attain certitude that He is the First and the Last, He is the Manifest and the Hidden. He is the Creator and the Provider. He is the Omnipotent and the All-Knowing. He is the All-Hearing. And He is the All-Seeing and the All-Hearing. He is the Subduer and the Self-Sustaining. He is the Giver of life and the Cause of death. He is the Omnipotent and the Inaccessible. He is the Exalted and the Most High.

6 He does not and will not signify anything except His own exaltation in glorification, His sublimity in sanctity, His inaccessibility in oneness, and His loftiness in greatness. He has no primacy except through His own primality, and He has no finality except through His own finality. Every thing that has been measured within Him or will be measured has become a "thing" through its "thingness" and has been realized through its "existence." By Him, God initiated the creation of all things, and unto Him, the creation of all things returns. He is the One to whom all the Most Beautiful Names belong and have always belonged.

7 The essence of His being is sanctified beyond every name and description, and His luminous reality transcends all loftiness and sublimity. His pure essence is sanctified from every restriction and elevation. He is the First, yet cannot be known through it. He is the Last, yet cannot be described through it. He is the Manifest, yet cannot be defined by it. He is the Hidden, yet cannot be comprehended by it.

8 He is the first to believe in *Him Whom God shall make manifest*, and He is the first to believe in the one who has been manifested. He is the unique reality through whom the creation of all things takes place. Through His provision, all things are sustained. Through His death, the death of all things is revealed. Through His life, the life of all things is manifested. Through His resurrection, the resurrection of all things is disclosed.

9 A Countenance has arisen, the like of which the eyes of existence have never beheld—neither before nor after this. This is the visage of divinity and the countenance of lordship, settled under the shadow of the face of God’s divinity, and signifying the sovereignty of oneness. Had it been known that the love of this Countenance could be tasted by all things, its mention would not have ceased. When it was not bowed to the essence of its being was created as it is and upon what it stands. Otherwise, nothing would experience the taste of its love.

10 Light upon light within light leading to light upon light: God guides to His light whomsoever He wills, and He elevates to His light whomever He desires. He is the Originator and the Restorer. He is the One God, the Singular, whose own self-manifestation has brought forth eighteen souls. These souls were created from His essence before all things, and He has established their recognition within the innermost reality of all things. This serves the purpose of enabling all beings to testify, through their own essence, that He is the One, the First, and the Ever-Living.

11 No decree has been issued for any contingent being except the recognition of His essence. This recognition sanctifies His being from all that is other than Him. At His command, all things are created, for to Him belong the creation and the command, from before and after. He is the Lord of all worlds.

12 It should not remain hidden from the observer of these words that God caused the Qur’án to return on the Day of Resurrection with the manifestation of His own essence within it. Thereafter, He brought all things into being anew. It was as though all things were created for the first time, for everything that has been created exists for the Day of the Manifestation of God. He is the One to whom all things turn and the One to whom all things ultimately return. When He appeared with the manifestation of His signs of power, there was no doubt that all things attained, to the utmost extent possible, the meeting with God.

13 Once again, God, exalted and glorious, created the Primal Will and, through it, brought forth all things. The mention of the creation of all things as a wondrous act serves as proof that His creation has eternally existed and shall forever exist. For when no contingent being existed, God was still God, and there was no creation to restore. Verily, God has always been in the loftiness of His sanctity. Whatever is beneath Him remains confined within the limits of its own proximity.

14 The first creation of all things occurred at this very moment, which is described as the Day of Friday. It has been decreed as a day of remembrance of God. The Lord of Might and Glory created this wondrous creation by His command and established it under His shadow until He returns it. There is no doubt that God originates this creation and then brings it back, and verily God is powerful over all things. The arrangement of the creation of all things has been made in accordance with the number of all things, through commandments revealed from His sanctified realm. These commandments have arisen as the dawning rays of His bountiful sun so that all things, through the remembrance of all things in all things, might attain perfection in preparation for the appearance of the final resurrection.

15 On that Day, every thing shall be recompensed with the reward of all things, whether it be through His justice for the self or through His grace for confirmations. His knowledge of all things before all things mirrors His knowledge of all things after all things, just as His power over all things before creation matches His power over all things after their creation. God has eternally been all-knowing of all things and omnipotent over all things. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names, from before and after. All who are in the heavens, on the earth, and between them glorify Him. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved.

16 With the eye of certainty, observe that the gates of the religion of the Bayán are arranged according to the number of all things. Beneath the shadow of each gate, the angels of the heavens, the earth, and what lies between them are prostrate by the permission of God. They magnify, sanctify, glorify, and revere Him. They perform their duties and exalt Him. On the Day of the Manifestation of God, which is the appearance of the Point of the Bayán in its final state, all will return unto Him. Whenever all things return unto Him, even the souls of those who had refused, the fruits of all things shall be made manifest before Him. Blessed is the one who is gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the presence of God and who turns toward His countenance.

17 God has determined that each gate of the gates of all things serves as a reality unto itself. To it, all accounts return by virtue of the Bayán, according to what has been enacted in that gate. Hasten, then, to this, and hasten again, and yet again, and once more, and once more. This is because God is the swiftest of all reckoners. There may arise a situation where not all gates of all things present themselves before Him. In such a case, He will decree the return of the creation of the Bayán, and the heavens elevated in the Bayán will be folded in His grasp, just as the heavens of the Qur’án were encompassed before Him. Though the gates of the Qur’án were numerous and varied for the believers, when God brought forth the creation of the Qur’án to His light, they all became a single reality, a single gate from among the gates of remembrance. Thus does God do as He wills and ordains what He desires. He is not questioned about what He does, but all shall be questioned concerning all things.

18 At the moment when the entirety of the Qur’án is returned, and the beginning of the creation of all things within the Bayán takes place, the Point—manifesting lordship—shall stand upon the land named Basṭ. The heavens elevated in the Qur’án shall be folded entirely and return to the first Point. None shall bear witness to this except God and those near Him.

19 Although no matter was revealed in the Qur’án more momentous than the Day of Resurrection, God, the Reckoner, accounted for the total number of souls who adhered to the religion of the Qur’án. Upon their return, one soul from among all these souls stood in the presence of God. This soul became the return of all things, and the creation of all things in another dispensation was elevated by God’s command. Take heed, O people of the Bayán, to guard yourselves so that you do not veil yourselves from God, your Lord, while you claim by night and by day that you love Him or sanctify Him.

## Vahid 1 (Tawhid - Oneness and Unity)

### Gate 1 (There is No God But God)

In the first gate of the number of all things, God, exalted and glorified, has decreed as an obligation the word: *"There is no God but God, truly, truly."*

All of the Bayán will return to this word, and the spreading forth of the final creation will arise from it. The recognition of this word is dependent on the recognition of the Point of the Bayán, whom God has made the essence of the Seven Letters within it.

Whoever attains certainty that it is the Point of the Qur’án in its finality and the Point of the Bayán in its beginning, and that it is the Primal Will, self-sustaining, and through which all things are created by its command and sustained by it, has attained true faith.

Its essence bears witness to the oneness of its Lord. Whoever does not believe in it shall be cast into the fire. And what fire is greater than that for one who does not believe in it? Conversely, whoever believes in it shall enter affirmation. And what paradise is loftier than that for one who believes in it?

This is the word that has been exalted, magnified, glorified, sanctified, and extolled by its Lord morning and evening. Regard this word as you would regard the sun in the sky. Look upon one who believes in it as you would look upon a mirror, for every believer in the essence of the Seven Letters derives their being from one of the names of God, exalted and glorified.

Externally, such a one is a leaf from the Tree of Affirmation. All things return to this one reality, and all things are created through this one reality. This singular reality, on the Day of Resurrection, is none other than *Him Whom God shall make manifest*, who declares in every instance: *"I am God. There is no God but Me, the Lord of all things. All besides Me are My creation. O My creation, worship Me."*

He is the mirror of God through whom the mirror of dominion is manifested, composed of the Living Letters. Nothing can be seen within Him but God. Whoever in the Bayán utters the word *"There is no God but God"* is thereby directed toward God.

Just as creation begins with Him, so too does creation return to Him. The purpose of this world is that, at the time of the appearance of *Him Whom God shall make manifest*, people do not claim, “We say There is no God but God and that is the essence of religion.” This is because what they say is but a reflection of His sun, which was manifested during His first appearance. He is more deserving of this word than all the essences of creation, through His very self.

The mirror declares, “The sun is within me,” but before the sun, it is evident that the mirror reflects its light. He proclaims: *"We have known you, O people of the Bayán! The loftiness of your existence lies in the word of your Lord. Do not veil yourselves from Him Whom God shall make manifest on the Day of Resurrection, in truth. For what you speak within your hearts is like His appearance in your innermost beings, and what He speaks is what God has borne witness to of Himself—that there is no God but Him, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting."*

Today, any soul that utters this word, the essence of all religion, undoubtedly speaks in the voice of Muhammad, the Messenger of God—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him and His family—of the past. The sun of this word has been within their hearts, and what manifests from them today is but a reflection of it. Thus, in His next appearance, He will return to them, in the appearance of the Point of the Bayán, not in His first manifestation.

During His first manifestation, the tree of oneness had not yet been elevated within the essences of creation. Now, after one thousand two hundred and seventy years, this tree has reached the stage of bearing fruit. Whoever is within it is but a reflection of the sun of the Point of the Criterion (*furqán*), which is identical to the Point of the Bayán. Before Him, this must necessarily become apparent.

An example is set forth in the supreme word, upon which the entirety of religion is established. Through its utterance, the foundation of all religion is confirmed. In the hour of death, all will speak this word and return to Him.

The reflections within mirrors inevitably return to their origin. When the mirrors reflect the image of the sun, they return to it, for their existence began with it. The mirrors' purpose lies solely in their capacity as mirrors, reflecting the sun from which they originated. The exaltation of the Word of the *Furqán* in the past, and the exaltation of the Word of the Bayán in the future, reflect a similar pattern relative to the Sun of Truth.

Consider the various aspects arising from this Word, such as the knowledge of the names of God, the recognition of the Prophet, the recognition of the Imáms of guidance, the gates of guidance, and the innumerable branches of subsidiary matters.

Each soul that becomes veiled by one of these aspects is thereby separated from the reality of its own existence, which originated from God and will ultimately return to Him, provided it stems from the Tree of Affirmation.

The sign of its oneness should testify to the Sun. If, God forbid, it does not testify to the Sun, it is unworthy of mention. Consider the souls that associate themselves with the Qur’án. How much of their judgment contradicts what God has revealed, as evidenced by their actions. These contradictions pertain to their essence, not the branches arising from their essence.

That which branches into what is less than the truth reverts to its essence. If its essence does not testify to God, it is not worthy of mention before Him. However, that which branches from true essences will ultimately return to those essences. If these essences are steadfast signs, residing firmly within the mirrors of their hearts rather than merely being transient, they will return to their proper stations both in origin and in return.

As the sun has eternally shone forth, these mirrors eternally bear witness. The bounty of God has never been withheld or exhausted in any circumstance. Blessed is the one who declares: *"God is my Lord, and I associate no partner with Him in His Lordship."*

Verily, the essence of the Seven Letters is the gate of God. I shall not invoke any gate alongside Him, and whoever believes in *Him Whom God shall make manifest* attains thereby the first gate of the One, the First. Blessed are those who succeed on this great day. This is the day when all are presented before God, their Lord,

### Gate 2 (Muhammad and His Manifestations Returned)

The essence of this gate is that Muhammad—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him—and the manifestations of His own self returned to this world.

They were the first of His servants to be present in the presence of God on the Day of Resurrection, acknowledging His oneness and delivering the signs of His gate to all. God fulfilled His promise, as stated in the Qur’án: *"And We desired to show favor to those who were oppressed in the land and to make them leaders and to make them inheritors."*

He made them Imáms. The same reasoning that establishes the prophethood of Muhammad—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him—is evident in their return to this world before God and the learned ones. This is proven by the signs of God, which no one on earth can imitate, for they are utterly incapable of producing anything comparable.

There is no doubt that the nobility of a servant lies in affirming the oneness of God, recognizing Him, acknowledging His justice, obeying Him, and being content with His will. Similarly, there is no doubt that these sanctified souls attained the essence of all loftiness and glory before any other soul.

Every living being that imagines honor finds it only through the good pleasure of God. There is no doubt that they were the first lights to bow before God, accepting the signs that He revealed through His gate and conveying them.

There exists no loftier station in the realm of possibility than this: that the heart of a servant bears witness to God. No one should remain veiled from their Beloved to the extent of nineteen times nine. Every soul, in whatever it undertakes during its life, wills nothing but the good pleasure of God. This is the ultimate aim of all.

There is no doubt that the good pleasure of God is only made manifest through the pleasure of one upon whom God has conferred His proof. It is certain that these sanctified lights attained the good pleasure of God before all things. This is the loftiest elevation above every loftiness and the most sublime distinction above all other distinctions.

It is beyond doubt that their return in the final manifestation is greater in the sight of God than their initial appearance. Just as prophethood was established in the past, today guardianship (*wiláyah*) is established.

Even though the appearance of the Point of the Bayán is identical to the appearance of Muhammad, their return is also the same. However, through the manifestation of God, all names exist under His shadow and testify to Him. He is the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. God has set apart their names during this cycle as the Living Letters (*ḥurúf-i-ḥayy*).

This refers to the fourteen sanctified souls and the hidden and preserved name, which is associated with the Four Gates, the Lights of the Throne, or the Bearers of Creation, Sustenance, Death, and Life. These collectively amount to the number of *ḥayy* (18), representing the closest names to God. Everything besides them is guided through their guidance. God began the creation of the Bayán with them, and He will cause the return of the creation of the Bayán through them. They are lights that have eternally existed. They have eternally been and will continue to be prostrate before the Throne of Truth.

In every manifestation, they have been mentioned by a particular name among the people. With each appearance, their physical names may have changed, yet their essential names, which signify God and manifest within their hearts, remain constant. Without the nearness of their essence, they could not have stood in the presence of God, who has eternally existed and will forever exist.

God has names beyond limit, yet all are revealed through these names. Just as the guidance of all depends on their guidance, in the hearts of these names nothing is seen but God. Indeed, within the heart of any believing soul, whether male or female, there is no vision but that of the name upon which their heart depends, granted by God. Within them, nothing is perceived except: *"He is God, the One. To Him belong creation and command, from before and after. There is no God but Him, the Living, the Self-Subsisting."*

Every soul that believed in Muhammad, peace be upon Him, or in anyone before Him, has returned under His shadow. *"And each shall be recompensed for what they have earned, and God is witness over all things."*

### Gate 3 (Ali Returned)

This pertains to ‘Alí, upon Him be peace, who returned to this world with those who believed in Him and those beneath them. He is the second to believe in the Point after Sín (\*the letter "S").

### Gate 4 (Fatimah Returned)

This pertains to Fáṭimah, peace be upon her, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in her and those beneath her.

### Gate 5 (Hasan Returned)

This pertains to Ḥasan, upon Him be peace, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 6 (Husayn Returned)

This pertains to Ḥusayn, upon Him be peace, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 7 (Ali ibn al-Husayn Returned)

This pertains to ʿAlí ibn al-Ḥusayn, peace be upon Him, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 8 (Muhammad ibn Ali Returned)

This pertains to Muḥammad ibn ʿAlí, peace be upon Them, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### **Gate 9 (Ja'far ibn Muhammad Returned)**

This pertains to Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad, peace be upon Them, who returned to the life of this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 10 (Musa ibn Ja'far Returned)

This pertains to Músá ibn Jaʿfar, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 11 (Ali ibn Musa Returned)

This pertains to ʿAlí ibn Músá, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 12 (Muhammad ibn 'Ali Returned)

This pertains to Muḥammad ibn ʿAlí, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 13 (Ali ibn Muhammad Returned)

This pertains to ʿAlí ibn Muḥammad, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 14 (Hasan ibn Ali Returned)

This pertains to Ḥasan ibn ʿAlí, peace be upon Them, who returned to this world with all who believed in Him and those beneath them.

### Gate 15 (Appearance of the Proof)

This pertains to the appearance of the Ḥujjat, peace be upon Him, through the signs and clear evidences in the manifestation of the Point of the Bayán, which is identical to the manifestation of the Furqán. Although the Point of the Bayán appeared first and the Point of the Furqán appeared second, the manifestation of the Hujjat occurred in the Fifteenth Gate.

The wisdom behind this lies in the fact that the Point, in its state of abstraction, represents the pure manifestation of God. In the station of divinity (*ulūhiyyat*), it is manifest in the first position mentioned. In the station of determination, which is the primal will (*mashiyyat awliyyah*), it is mentioned in the second position. In the station of upholding all souls, which is specific to the Fourteenth Manifestation, it is mentioned in the Fifteenth Gate.

The Point, in its station of primality, has eternally existed and will forever remain. It is most deserving of embodying all names from the essence of the names themselves. For example, when the name of divinity is mentioned, the name of lordship is also present, along with all other names. Despite this, it is always manifest under the name of divinity in the station of the Point.

The examples of all names, in their exalted realities, appear from Him: *"He is the First when He is the Last, and He is the Hidden when He is the Manifest. He is the One who is mentioned by every name at the time when He is not mentioned by any but the name: There is no God but Him, the Self-Subsisting Sustainer."*

### Gate 16 (The First Gate Returns)

This pertains to the return of the First Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

### Gate 17 (The Second Gate Returns)

This pertains to the return of the Second Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

### Gate 18 (The Third Gate Returns)

This pertains to the return of the Third Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

### Gate 19 (The Fourth Gate Returns)

This pertains to the return of the Fourth Gate to this world with all who believed in Him in truth, and those beneath them.

## Vahid 2 (The Day of Resurrection)

### Gate 1 (Recognition of the Proof and the Evidence)

This explains the recognition of the Proof (*ḥujjat*) and the Evidence (*dalīl*).

The summary of this gate is as follows: God, exalted be His glory, in every cycle sends forth a proof corresponding to the highest station of loftiness by which the people of that cycle take pride. For instance, during the time of the Qur’án’s revelation, the pride of all people lay in the eloquence of speech. Therefore, God revealed the Qur’án with the utmost loftiness of eloquence and established it as the miracle of the Messenger of God, peace be upon Him. In the Qur’án, God affirmed the truth of the Messenger of God and the religion of Islam through its verses, which are the greatest of evidences.

The greatness of this proof lies in the fact that all speak through alphabetical letters, yet God revealed the words of the Qur’án in such a manner that if all who are upon the earth were to gather and attempt to produce a single verse comparable to those of the Qur’án, they would be unable. All would be rendered powerless.

The secret of this lies in the fact that God revealed the Qur’án from the Tree of Will (*mashiyyat*), which is the Muhammadan reality, in the language of the Prophet Himself. That Tree, being inaccessible, reveals no letter except that it draws forth the spirit of the thing upon its descent.

For example, if it is revealed: *"We have initiated this creation as a command from Us, established over all things."* When the term "initiation" is mentioned, it encompasses everything that is associated with the name of all things. This is because none but God encompasses all things, and only His word can transcend and dominate over all things. Through His utterance, all creation begins.

Similarly, if God reveals: *"And indeed, We worship this creation as a promise from Us; verily, We have power over all things."*

At the moment of the descent of this word, it takes hold of the spirits of all things and causes their return within the manifestation of this verse. This ensures that, on the Day of Resurrection, all things shall be present before God, confirming the truth of their return.

None but God is capable of this, for whatever God speaks emanates from the Tree of Reality itself. Through it, the essence of a thing is created.

If something lies below the station of *ʿIlliyyīn* (the exalted ones), it is negated from the Letters of Affirmation. Conversely, if it is from the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, it is affirmed as part of them. This is because the word of God is truth, and in everything where it is revealed, the essence of that thing becomes attached to it so that it may testify to its truth.

Thus, it has already been revealed: *“The fire is true, and paradise is true.”* The act of creation and the spirit of the Word are established as truth in their respective stations. Any soul that contemplates this will certainly observe that the spirits of truth are embodied through the manifestation of the primal Point in the signs of God within the realities of souls and the horizons.

As God previously mentioned in the Qur’án: *"We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth."*

Until one perceives the essence of all things, which is the spirit of their heart, they cannot comprehend the realization that *“The word of God is truth.”* It is not merely through verbal mention that the realization of truth occurs within the essence of a thing. This reality is unique to God, exalted and glorified. None but Him is the creator of things, the provider of things, the one who causes their death, and the one who brings them to life.

Every word that is affirmed or negated in His dominion occurs within the shadow of that which He has revealed through His signs. In reality, these words themselves are nothing other than what manifests through the appearances of the signs of God and His words.

For when God mentions a believer, the creation of that believer is brought into being. Similarly, when He reveals something as being below the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, the spirits of that entity are created in accordance with it. This is the secret of why the signs of God are a proof over all creation and the greatest of evidences.

The clear evidences (*bayyinát*) and the most magnificent manifestations are proofs of His power and knowledge. There is no doubt that during the cycle of the Point of the Bayán, the pride of the people of understanding (*ulú'l-albáb*) was in the knowledge of oneness, the subtleties of understanding, and the inaccessible realities recognized by those with true insight.

For this reason, God placed the knowledge of His proof, like the proof of the Messenger of God, within the very essence of His verses. He caused words to flow from His tongue at the height of oneness and the loftiness of abstraction, such that every soul possessing the spirit of oneness humbly submitted to Him, except for those who failed to comprehend what He spoke to His Beloved.

From Him emanated countless expressions of wisdom and knowledge, which none but God has understood or recognized. Even though the manifestation of the Sun of Truth itself inspires all contingent beings to comprehend His loftiness, it is through the verses and words bestowed upon Him by God that He has drawn all existences to the radiance of His signs. *“He has no equal by which He may be known, no peer by which He may be described, no likeness by which He may be compared, no partner with whom He may be associated, nor any similitude by which He may be likened. Exalted is God far above all such comparisons, supremely glorified!”*

In Him, nothing is seen but God, and indeed, all are devoted worshippers before Him. During this cycle, God has bestowed upon the Point of the Bayán His verses and clear evidences, making Him an impenetrable proof against all things. Even if all who dwell upon the earth were to gather, they could not produce a single verse comparable to those which God caused to flow from His tongue.

Any soul that contemplates these verses with certainty observes that they are beyond human capacity. These verses are exclusively from God, the One, the Absolute. God has caused His words to flow from the tongue of whomever He wills and will not cause them to flow except from the Point of Will (*mashiyyat*). He is the sender of all messengers and the revealer of all scriptures.

If this matter had been within human capacity, someone should have been able to produce verses comparable to the Qur’án during the 1,270 years from its revelation to the revelation of the Bayán. However, despite the loftiness of their power, all who attempted to extinguish the Word of God failed utterly.

Even today, if anyone examines the time from the initial revelation of the Bayán until now, they will surely observe that those who acknowledged the proof of its verses and proclaimed them to all were indeed the proofs (*ḥujjaj*) of God. Even if their proof had not been outwardly evident, their spiritual exaltation and insight were undeniable.

The lowest of the disciples of the late, exalted Sayyid—the Exalted One (*Siyyid-i-A‘lá*)—surpassed in wisdom and understanding the scholars and sages of the earth. Among those who have affirmed the proof of the verses, whether from this community or others, there has never been any doubt concerning their elevated piety.

Though this statement is made in recognition of the weakness of people’s comprehension, it remains true that the testimony of God outweighs that of all who are upon the earth. There is no doubt that the testimony of God is only made manifest through the testimony of one whom He has appointed as His proof.

The self-evident nature of the verses is sufficient as testimony, rendering all who dwell upon the earth powerless before them. These verses are a lasting proof from God until the Day of Resurrection. If anyone reflects on the manifestation of this Tree of Will, they will undoubtedly affirm the loftiness of the Cause of God. Consider that this revelation emanates from a soul only 24 years of age, who was devoid of any formal training in the sciences learned by others. Despite this, the verses are recited with such fluency and clarity, without contemplation or hesitation.

In just five hours, he composes a thousand verses in supplication, without the pen ceasing. Interpretations and profound scientific insights emerge from him, demonstrating exalted stations of understanding and oneness that surpass the grasp of all scholars and sages. All who encounter such works admit their inability to comprehend them fully.

There is no doubt that all of this originates from God. Scholars who have labored their entire lives in study and effort struggle to compose even a single line of eloquent Arabic, often concluding with words unworthy of mention. All of this is a proof intended for creation, for the Cause of God is too exalted and majestic to be known except through Him.

Indeed, it is through Him that others are known, not the reverse. By the essence of the one true God, whose existence is singular and eternal, the signs of this revelation are brighter than the light of the sun at midday. The effects of those who have been guided by Him, even if they ascend to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding, resemble the light of stars in the night compared to the brightness of His guidance.

May God forgive such comparisons. How can the ocean of eternity be grasped by the sea of contingency? How can the remembrance of the primordial be likened to the remembrance of limitations?

*Glorified and exalted is God above all that is mentioned by earthly and heavenly allusions.*

All that has been described pertains to the limited realms of creation. However, this is exactly how the argument unfolds in this Resurrection, just as God previously questioned through His own tongue: *“Whose book is the Qur’án?”* All the believers responded: *“It is the Book of God.”*

God then asked: *“Is there any difference between the Furqán and the Bayán?”* The hearts replied: *“No, by God! All is from our Lord, and none will take heed except those endowed with insight.”*

God then revealed: *“That was My word through the tongue of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, peace be upon Him. This is My word through the tongue of the Essence of the Seven Letters, the Gate of God, peace be upon Him.”*

Whoever believes in it has no refuge if they wish to remain steadfast in their faith except to believe in these verses. Otherwise, their essence will be rendered void, and their deeds will become as though they were nothing, unmentioned and forgotten.

God then revealed: \*“O My creation! All of you, from the beginning of your lives to their end, strive with utmost effort to earn My good pleasure. If you act upon any secondary matter, it is because I have revealed it in My Book. If you believe in the Imáms of guidance or seek nearness to Me through visiting their graves, it is because their celestial status has been alluded to in the Qur’án. If you acknowledge the prophethood of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, it is because He is My Messenger. If you circumambulate around the Kaʿbah, it is because I have called it My house. If you revere the Qur’án, it is because it is My word.”\*

Indeed, upon every soul—even if it belongs to the nation of Adam—whatever one does is based on their relationship to Me, as they perceive it within themselves. However, they remain veiled, holding false assumptions and failing to recognize the realities of subsequent manifestations of My Cause. There is nothing whose judgment does not return to this human form, which has been created by My command.

This form returns degree by degree until it reaches My Prophet. The prophethood of My Prophet is not established except through the Book revealed to Him and the proof granted to Him. Today, which is the Day of My Manifestation, I have appeared in My very self. This utterance is like the mention of the Kaʿbah, which I have called My House.

In reality, for My essence, there is neither a beginning nor an end, neither manifestation nor concealment. Today, whatever returns to this self, which recites My verses, returns to Me. Whatever does not return to Him does not return to Me. This is My manifestation in My very self and My concealment in My very essence, for this possible reality cannot exist in possibility itself. No station higher than this can be conceived in the Bayán.

How greatly veiled you are, O people, imagining that all your actions in your respective positions are for My good pleasure. Yet the verse that signifies Me and the signs of My power, whose treasures reside in His innate being, are recited by My permission. Despite this, you have confined Him unjustly to a mountain that none of its inhabitants is worthy of mention. Before Him, who is with Me, there exists none but a single soul, one of the Living Letters of My Book. Before Him, who stands in My presence, My hand bears witness, and no single lamp of light suffices as proof. However, in the positions reached through the progression of degrees, numerous lamps shine brightly. All upon the earth, created for Him, are sustained by His radiance, yet remain veiled from Him to the extent of a single lamp.

On this day, I bear witness to My creation, and apart from My testimony, nothing holds any value before Me. No paradise is greater for My creation than being in the presence of My very self and believing in My verses. Similarly, no fire is more severe than the veiling of these souls from the Manifestation of My self and their rejection of My verses.

You claim to act on My behalf, yet how does this benefit you? Do you not see My verses confirming what you previously claimed in My Book? Even now, you feel no shame, despite witnessing that My Book is firmly established and all who believe in it believe in Me. Soon, you will see that your pride will be in your faith in these verses. Yet today, what benefits your souls is proclaiming belief in what does not benefit you and veils you from My cause, bringing harm to yourselves.

No harm has reached or will reach the Manifestation of My self. Whatever harm has occurred or will occur returns to your own souls. Show compassion for yourselves, and do not ascend in the air of imagined satisfaction of My will while veiling yourselves from the truth of My good pleasure.

My good pleasure is manifest through the proof by which the religion of all is established. Yet, you remain veiled from it, even as you associate yourselves with the Qur’án. By My sanctified essence, no paradise for this creation is loftier than the manifestation.

There is no paradise greater than union with Me and My verses, and no fire more severe than being veiled from Me and My verses. If you claim that your inability is not evident to you, then journey throughout the east and west of the earth. Yet, this statement is meaningless, for today the truth of all upon the earth is connected to the Dispensation of Islam.

If the eloquent ones of this Dispensation are unable to produce the like of these verses, it is evidence that all are powerless. If they claim they are not powerless, why do they not produce a verse similar to My verses, born of innate reality rather than acquired knowledge or theft?

In every age, before the truth, even those like the sorcerers of Moses’ time demonstrated what was within their capacity. Praise be to God that, from the time of My manifestation to today, even such demonstrations have not appeared from the scholars of this Dispensation. They falsely claim to ascend toward the loftiness of God's satisfaction while remaining veiled from the true Manifestation of His power.

This alone suffices as the abasement of the scholars of Islam. They claim knowledge of Islam and promote its teachings while veiling themselves from Him whose word establishes Islam. If they were merely content with their own veiling and refrained from wronging others or judging contrary to what was revealed in the Qur’án, their fate would still be the fire of their own deeds.

However, they have worsened their condition and that of those who regard them as scholars of Islam. Indeed, whoever is veiled from the manifestation of God faces their own punishment. If they were to reflect upon the verses of God, they would observe their own incapacity. In that moment, neither rulership nor Islam and those under its shadow would not have been content with veiling themselves from the truth. The pride of all lies in following the truth. If their actions had not been ambiguous to themselves, matters would not have reached this point. There is no doubt that God will manifest His truth to all through His proof, as He does even today.

If anyone who associates themselves with Islam—whether from among those in positions of authority or those considered scholars—wishes to affirm the proof of these verses, it would be achieved in less than the blink of an eye. If they possess power, they could summon all the scholars and say to them, "Through your judgments, you have caused veiling from the one who possesses the verses."

The matter can only take one of two forms: either they themselves have brought forth a book and its verses are present, or they have not. If they have not, this verse, written here, is sufficient:

*"Glorified are You, O God! You are the Sovereign of sovereigns. You bestow sovereignty upon whomever You will and remove it from whomever You will. You exalt whomever You will and abase whomever You will. You grant victory to whomever You will and forsake whomever You will. You enrich whomever You will and impoverish whomever You will. You manifest whomever You will over whomever You will. In Your grasp is the dominion of all things. You create what You will by Your command. Verily, You are all-knowing, omnipotent, and powerful."*

Speak in the manner He has spoken, naturally and innately. Write in the manner He has written, without pause or hesitation. If you cannot, it is proof that your deeds have been carried out without truth, and the bearer of these verses is the Truth, sent from God, and there is no doubt that God has revealed these verses upon him just as He revealed upon the Messenger of God. Today, the amount of verses resembling these totals over a hundred thousand verses, in addition to his scrolls of supplications and his scientific and wisdom-filled compositions.

In just five hours, a thousand verses emanate from him, or as quickly as a scribe is able to transcribe them. He recites the verses of God. This makes it possible to estimate that, had his works been freely disseminated from the beginning of the manifestation until today, an unimaginable quantity of works would have been spread among the people.

If you claim that these verses are not sufficient proofs in themselves, consider the Qur’án. Did God, in proving the prophethood of the Messenger of God—may God’s blessings and peace be upon Him and His family—use anything other than His verses as proof? Reflect upon this.

God has revealed:

*"None disputes concerning the signs of God except those who disbelieve, so do not let their movement through the land deceive you. Those before them, like the people of Noah, rejected the truth, and every nation sought to seize their messenger. They disputed with falsehood to invalidate the truth, but I seized them, and how severe was My punishment! Thus, the decree of your Lord is fulfilled upon those who disbelieve, that they are the companions of the Fire."*

In affirming the sufficiency of the Book, God has revealed:

*"Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book, recited to them? Indeed, in that is a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe."*

When God Himself testifies to the sufficiency of the Book through its own verses, how can anyone claim otherwise? One cannot deny the sufficiency of the Book as proof. If someone repeats what the first objectors said, their stance falls into one of two categories: either their intent is to reject the truth outright—which brings them no benefit, as God has revealed:

*"Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it."*

And elsewhere:

*"Indeed, those upon whom the decree of your Lord has been fulfilled will not believe, even if every sign comes to them, until they see the painful punishment."*

Alternatively, their intent may be to act cautiously in matters of religion. If this is the case, the understanding is straightforward:

*"In what discourse, after God and His signs, will they believe?"*

They can either present themselves and inquire about their concerns in the manner of the verses, listening directly to what is recited—verses free from contemplation, formulation, or synthesis—or they can send someone to sit briefly in His presence, record what is recited from the verses of God, and reflect on them. They would then realize that these words are not the product of thought, combination, or contrivance.

If such a process were possible, it would have occurred with the Qur’án from the beginning of Islam until today. Similarly, since the onset of this Cause until now, no one has been able to produce anything comparable through such means. If objections are raised about the Arabic grammar or pronunciation within the recitation, such criticisms are invalid. This is because grammatical rules are derived from the verses themselves, not the other way around. There is no doubt that the bearer of the verses disclaims these rules and the associated knowledge for himself.

In truth, the lack of adherence to these rules, while presenting verses of this nature and such words, holds no bearing for those of understanding (*ulú'l-albáb*). There is no greater accomplishment than understanding the Book of God, for the purpose of knowledge is to comprehend His Book. The Tree upon which the Book of God is revealed does not require knowledge of these sciences. Rather, all grammatical rules and expressions are derived from what God has revealed and are established upon it.

Many individuals possess extensive knowledge of these sciences, yet their faith in the verses of God is firmly established. This is because the purpose of knowledge is to understand the commands of God and follow His good pleasure, not to remain distant from them. If these sciences themselves bore fruit, the learned ones of Arabia would have surpassed the non-Arabs in their spiritual station. However, true honor lies not in these sciences but in the good pleasure of God, knowledge of His oneness, and abiding in the shadow of obedience to Him and satisfaction with Him.

There is no doubt that most actions performed between individuals and God are intended to seek His good pleasure. Yet, few truly comprehend His good pleasure unless they discern the pleasure of His proof. Today, the good pleasure of God is inseparable from the good pleasure of His proof and those who dwell under His shadow. Even though others may consider themselves rightly guided, only what God testifies to remains enduring. The deeds of those who do not follow the command of God will perish.

Just as the rejection of the Qur’án by certain figures—such as Christian monks and the eloquent of the Arabs—was remembered in the early days of Islam, so too will the veiling of people today be remembered. Today, there is no action more beneficial for a servant than to examine the verses of the Bayán with fairness, observing the truth of the truth with absolute certainty. Through this, they may recognize the manifestation of meeting with Him is the meeting with God, and His good pleasure is the good pleasure of God. None should remain veiled, for all were created for this purpose, as God has revealed:

*"It is God who raised the heavens without pillars you see, then established Himself upon the Throne. He subjected the sun and the moon, each running for a specified term. He manages the affair, explains the signs, so that you may attain certainty in the meeting with your Lord."*

There is no doubt that any mirror turning toward the sun becomes illuminated by it. Without this, the sun itself rises and sets without affecting the mirror. The honor of all creation lies in attaining the fruit of their existence: the meeting with God and belief in His verses. Without this, the very existence of a thing becomes void. This is the same tree that planted the Qur’án within the hearts of the people for the sake of today. Today, all take pride and exalt themselves in relation to it and act accordingly.

This is the meaning of *"There is no power and no strength except in God"* in the realm of divine legislation. If they were to remove the unfounded claims of association with Him, they would not possess even the strength of a fly. This abasement alone is sufficient for those who are veiled, as they claim association with Him yet act as they do. Instead of supporting Him as the fruit of their existence and His victory today, they neither support Him nor even accept being neutral. Were they content with neutrality, this Tree would not have been confined to this mountain.

God suffices as the ultimate judge over all His servants. He will judge with justice, and His judgment is manifest in these very words. This judgment will distinguish, until the Day of Resurrection, between those who turn toward Him and those who do not. All matters of divine decree He is the best of helpers, the best of protectors, the best of reckoners, and the best of judges.

### Gate 2 (Understanding and Interpreting the Bayan)

1 None can encompass the knowledge of what God has revealed in the Bayán except those whom God wills.

2 The essence of this gate is that no one can fully comprehend what God has revealed in the Bayán except *Him Whom God shall make manifest* or those to whom He grants knowledge.

3 This resembles the tree from which the Bayán has sprung. Even if all the oceans of the heavens and the earth were turned into ink, all things became pens, and all souls were made to record, they could not interpret a single letter of the Bayán as it truly is.

4 God has not given any letter of the Bayán a beginning or an end.

5 None is permitted to interpret what God has revealed in the Bayán except the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* under the shadow of *Him Whom God shall make manifest* and the Letters of the Living. All other letters beneath *ʿIlliyyīn* belong to the gates of the fire.

6 The Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* will be gathered under His shadow, while all other letters will be gathered under the shadow of negation. The past is as the future, and there is no change in the decree of God, just as the "before" of the past is as the "after" of the future.

7 The Qur’án comprises 114 surahs, with every six surahs corresponding to the exalted station of each letter of *Bismilláh al-Raḥmán al-Raḥím* ("In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate"). The first six surahs are associated with the *Bá’*, and the last six surahs are associated with the *Mím*.

8 All the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* are connected to the manifestations of the 19, while the gates of the fire are connected to the First Gate. Similarly, all the gates of paradise return to the First Gate. Ultimately, everything is encompassed in the phrase:

*"There is no God but God."*

9 All that lies beneath the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* is gathered under negation, while all that pertains to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* is gathered under affirmation. All the Letters beneath *ʿIlliyyīn* in the Qur’án are subsumed under the shadow of the First Gate of the fire and pass away.

10 In contrast, all the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* in the Qur’án remain under the shadow of the Word of Affirmation. *“Thus does God enrich whomsoever He wills and preserve whomsoever He desires. Verily, He is powerful, mighty, and capable.”*

11 It is impermissible to interpret the Bayán except through what has been interpreted by its Tree. All the names of His goodness are manifest in the radiance of the hearts of His believers. Likewise, all the letters beneath His *ʿIlliyyīn* are reflected in the realities of those who are not believers in Him.

Eternally, the Bayán is like the human soul, alive, with all its Letters of Light and Fire apparent in the horizons and within the souls. Today, anyone wishing to discern can do so, as this is the Day of the Manifestation of God, the Mighty. However, after the Tree is lifted, no one will have the capacity to discern the true reality except according to the apparent judgments of those who remain within the bounds of God.

Whoever adheres to these bounds belongs to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, while whoever transgresses them is beneath them—unless God, through His manifestation on the Day of Resurrection, resolves this creation.

At that time, the judgments of the Point of the Bayán at its final stage will reflect the judgments of its initial reality. Whoever believes in it belongs to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn*, while whoever does not believe in it is beneath them. God will distinguish between them with justice, for He is the best of judges.

The matter will reach the point where no mention of the Letters beneath *ʿIlliyyīn* remains except in the Book. That same Tree of Negation will recognize its own negation in comparison to the Letters of *ʿIlliyyīn* and, unknowingly, curse itself until the sun of truth rises again.

At that time, their lack of faith will become evident, just as all who have witnessed this Resurrection have observed this matter with certainty. Although they claim today to believe in God and the verses of the Qur’án, the Tree of Reality, upon which the Qur’án descended, resides in this mountain with a single soul.

In the appearance of the Sun of Truth, realities are unveiled, and veils are removed. Those souls who never conceived anything less than the good pleasure of God have given judgments contrary to divine satisfaction—judgments that the pen hesitates to record—while the true pleasure of God is only revealed through the good pleasure of His Manifestation.

*“Take heed, O people of insight, and guard yourselves against disobeying the command of God.”*

### Gate 3 (Two Proofs: The Verses and the Manifestation)

**The Third Gate of the One, the Second**: This pertains to the truth that within the Bayán lies the decree for all things.

The essence of this gate is that God has established two proofs upon all people: the verses of God and the soul upon whom these verses are revealed. The first proof is an enduring and apparent one, lasting until the Day of Resurrection. The second proof is manifest until the time of His concealment, at which point it becomes a hidden proof over all things, unknown to anyone.

For Him, there are witnesses who bear testimony from the moment of His concealment. These witnesses are superior to the enduring proof, which is the Bayán. They act as proof through His word, which He reveals until the Day of His Manifestation.

If, at the time of His manifestation, they become veiled from the one who has made them proofs, their condition will resemble the current scholars who, despite the words of one of the Imáms, peace be upon them—*“Look to those who transmit our traditions.”* They are regarded as leaders before the ruler and associate themselves with names unworthy of their station. If they were truthful in their words, they would not have veiled themselves from the one whose word establishes divine authority and prophethood. Rather, when they observed that the manifestation of truth conflicted with their position—based on the claims they had made and the judgments they had rendered—they issued decrees against God. Yet, in the Qur'an, God has not revealed anything more grievous than the one who turns away from the signs of God after hearing them.

There is no doubt that the signs of God are the radiant verses emanating from this tree. This is because the Essence of the Everlasting, from eternity to eternity, remains constant and unchanging. His signs manifest through His primal will, in which nothing is seen except God alone. Though today they do not pay attention to the signs of God, soon they will extol these signs with the utmost reverence, offering interpretations as though they were pure gold of a thousand measures, and they will boast of them, claiming a connection to God.

For instance, the Qur'an, revealed over twenty-three years, found no one during that time to record its original form. It was only the Commander of the Faithful, upon him be peace, who inscribed it upon the shoulder blade of a sheep and other available materials, as mentioned in the narration of the Cloak. Today, we observe innumerable copies of the Qur'an being written, ranging in value from one thousand to a hundred thousand gold coins. Printed editions are now sold at such high prices, accessible to most people. This illustrates the extent of human limits before God, leaving no doubt that God has revealed the details of all things with the utmost clarity through the enduring proof. Whoever claims that there is anything whose ruling, as it is and as it stands, is not mentioned in the Bayán has certainly not believed with unwavering certainty. Everything falls into one of two categories: it is either mentioned in the category of negation or in the category of affirmation. That which is detested pertains to the former, and that which is beloved by God pertains to the latter. Every name lower than the truth is mentioned in the first category, and every name of the truth is mentioned in the second.

This is the ink of the understanding of all things in the Bayán. Whoever bears witness to this will testify that nothing has been neglected, and God encompasses all things. There is no matter but that for the silent Book, God has ordained a speaking Book. Neither exists without the other, and whoever does not stray beyond the bounds of the silent Book, it is as though they adhere to the speaking Book. The speaking Book is He whom God will make manifest, and all things return to Him. If no one transgresses the bounds of the Bayán, such a person is a servant who has obeyed, and whoever is with Him is a witness over it before His appearance. However, when He appears, faith in all who claim faith will be severed, except for those who believe in Him. When faith is severed, how can testimony remain for those who were witnesses? Testimony is a branch of faith.

Therefore, fear God, O witnesses, and do not judge God, your Lord, with the same judgment passed by those who were witnesses in relation to the Qur'an concerning Me. Indeed, whoever judges Me has judged God, their Lord. These have not even a mustard seed of goodness in the sight of God, and such are the transgressors.

### Gate 4 (Letters of the Most High and Those Below Them)

From the second unity in the Bayán, concerning the mention of the letters of the Most High and those below them, the summary of this chapter is as follows: No letter has God revealed without assigning to it a spirit connected to it. This is why the believer is gladdened by the mention of paradise and the pleasure of God, and saddened by the mention of fire and that which is beneath God's satisfaction, such that it is as though the former brings delight and the latter causes torment.

All words revealed by God in the Bayán fall into one of two categories: either they are the words of the Most High or those below them. The spirits of the words of the Most High reside in paradise, while the spirits of those below them dwell in the fire. All letters below the Most High refer to "no god," and all the letters of the Most High refer to "but God." Just as the origin of all letters below the Most High begins with this phrase, the origin of all the letters of the Most High begins with that phrase which has eternally been in the exalted paradise. The former fades into insignificance in the lowest depths, while the latter rises in the highest paradise.

For example, if one observes the beginning of the tree of the Qur'an today, they will surely witness how the five letters of negation—first, second, third, fourth, and fifth—have faded into insignificance in the lowest depths, while the five letters denoting affirmation—Muhammad, \`Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, and Husayn—have risen in the highest paradise. The five letters of fire, when their letters are multiplied, become nineteen, as God has revealed: "Over it are nineteen." Thus, these five letters are names, when multiplied, result in the number one, just as all letters below the Most High pertain to this word, while all the letters of the Most High pertain to the word of affirmation. God created the realm of negation and decreed for it the fire, and He created the realm of affirmation and decreed for it paradise. This is because negation does not signify Him, while affirmation signifies Him. This pertains to the creation of negation and affirmation; their recording corresponds to their creation.

On the Day of Resurrection, all that branched out from the word of negation returns to the word of negation, and all the letters below the Most High, along with their associated spirits, are gathered under this word. Similarly, all that branched out from the word of affirmation on the Day of Resurrection returns to the word of affirmation, and all the letters of the Most High, along with their associated spirits, are gathered under it. Whoever dwells in negation resides in God's fire until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest, and whoever resides under the shadow of affirmation abides in God's paradise until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest.

The exaltation of the servant lies in reflecting upon the branching of these two words, observing how one diminishes endlessly while the other ascends endlessly. God's proof applies equally to both, for the signs of God are presented to both. The manifestations of negation, having rejected them, were negated, while the manifestations of affirmation accepted.

No fire is more intense than the manifestation of the word of negation, and no paradise is greater than the manifestation of affirmation. In the first case, the letters below the Most High revolve around it, and in the latter, the letters of the Most High revolve around it, until all return on the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. If they turn towards Him, they belong to the Most High, and if not, they belong to that which is beneath it. Blessed is the one who clings to the cord of God and places their trust in their Lord, for they shall not enter the fire but shall surely enter paradise by the permission of their Lord. Truly, this is the supreme bounty.

For this reason, when the servant recites the letters of the Most High, they find tranquility, as the spirits of those letters connect with them. This is the highest paradise of those who seek refuge, the sanctified, those who glorify, magnify, and exalt. Whenever the servant mentions the letters beneath the Most High, they desire that God's justice descend upon them, for their spirits connect with those letters. In such moments, one must seek refuge in God, exalted be His mention, to be safeguarded from their spirits.

On the Day of Resurrection, all whom God promised paradise in the Qur'an return to the tree of His love. This is the loftiest station of the paradise of those who attain God's pleasure and are delighted by their acknowledgment of His oneness. Conversely, those whom God promised the fire are returned to the word of negation, where they are tormented within that negation. No torment is greater than being veiled from God and believing in anything but Him, and no paradise is greater than belief in God and His signs.

Whenever a discerning observer reflects, they will see how the people of paradise hasten to enter it, even though their sustenance was but the leaves of trees. Meanwhile, the people of the fire enter the fire willingly, deriving benefits from the word of negation, which they boast about and through which they are tormented, though they are unaware. As God has revealed: "They consume fire in their bellies." In this way, the letters below the Most High return to their own spirits, while the letters of the Most High return to their own spirits.

No soul exists but that when they mention the letters of the Most High, the spirits of the angels associated with those letters observe them and send blessings upon them from God. Conversely, when mentioning the letters below the Most High, if done out of love for them, the spirits of the demons of fire observe them. If they do not seek refuge in God, those influences will affect them, even if only as passing thoughts. However, if they seek God's refuge and request His wrath upon those influences, no harm can reach them, not even equivalent to a mustard seed in religious detriment.

It is as though I see the letters of negation seeking refuge from negation at the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, though they themselves are the essence of that negation. At that time, they will find no refuge from their own fire except in Him Whom God will make manifest. When a servant says, "I seek refuge in God," if they are not within the religion of the Bayán, they will not be shielded from the fire. Indeed, they do not utter this phrase except by entering the religion, just as those who have entered the faith.

Seeking refuge in God is, in essence, seeking refuge in His proof. Whoever believed in Muhammad was safeguarded from God's fire because they sought refuge in Him. Even the letters of fire utter the phrase "I seek refuge in God," but it does not benefit them, for they do not seek refuge in His proof. This is because God revealed in the Qur'an: "And whoever believes in God," pairing it with the phrase that follows. Yet, they recite the phrase itself without understanding its implication.

In the early days of Islam, the interpretation of this phrase referred to the second figure, even though the entirety of the Qur'an was recited. At the time of the manifestation of the sign of divinity, it was the Commander of the Faithful, upon him be peace. Had they sought refuge in Him, they would have been saved from the succeeding word. Thus, all, until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest, seek refuge in God and the Point of the Bayán. However, this brings no benefit to them today, for seeking refuge in God on that day means seeking refuge in Him. Seeking refuge in the Point of the Bayán is seeking refuge in Him.

From the beginning of the manifestation of this tree, all have been saying "I seek refuge in God," yet they reside in the fire, except those whom God has willed, who have recognized the manifestation of this Name. Those who sought refuge in Him were safeguarded from the pure fire. Otherwise, countless souls utter this phrase daily, yet it offers no salvation for them. This is because God has paired seeking refuge in Him with seeking refuge in His Messenger, and seeking refuge in His Messenger with seeking refuge in His successors, and seeking refuge in His successors with seeking refuge in the gates of His successors. The first benefits none except through the last, nor does the outward avail except through the inward, for seeking refuge in the Messenger is identical to seeking refuge in God, and seeking refuge in the Imams is identical to seeking refuge in the Messenger.

And seeking refuge in the gates is identical to seeking refuge in the guardians. Whoever enters the Bayán today is safeguarded from the fire, just as the letters of the Alif were not safeguarded from the fire until they entered the letters of the Qur'an. The letters of the Bayán, until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest, reside in the Most High in paradise, while those below the Most High remain in their respective stations. On that day, whoever enters His Book will be saved from the fire; otherwise, remaining in the Bayán will yield no benefit, just as remaining in the Alif after the revelation of the Qur'an brought no benefit, nor did remaining in the Qur'an after the revelation of the Bayán.

Until God wills otherwise, the Most High ascends endlessly in its loftiest heights, while those below are cast into the utmost depths of nonexistence. Blessed is the one who nourishes their heart with the letters of the Most High and, when mentioning what is below them, seeks refuge in God, their Lord, for surely He will protect them. It is inevitable that these will be mentioned, yet their mention will not harm those who recite them, just as the believers in the Qur'an mentioned those who had received the Book before them. Thus, God distinguishes the signs so that you may attain certainty in His signs.

### Gate 5 (Every Name Pertains to Him Whom God Will Make Manifest)

The fifth chapter of the second unity states that every good name revealed by God in the Bayán primarily refers to Him Whom God will make manifest in its truest essence. Similarly, every evil name revealed by God in the Bayán refers, in its truest essence, to those who represent the word of negation in that day.

The summary of this chapter is that every name of any matter revealed in the Bayán pertains to Him Whom God will make manifest in its primary truth and, secondarily, to the first who believes in Him, extending to the final limit of existence. This is similar to the mention of the earth. When the term "earth" is mentioned, it primarily refers to His own essence, gradually descending until it reaches the physical earth associated with Him, which is His dwelling place, regarded as the loftiest chamber of paradise in the Book of God. Similarly, every lesser name of goodness revealed pertains, in its primary essence, to the tree that stands in opposition to negation. If the term "earth" is mentioned in relation to those below the Most High, it refers first to His own essence, gradually descending until it reaches the physical earth that is His dwelling place, which constitutes the ultimate end of the fire in the realm of fire—even if He is above the throne of majesty.

Likewise, every mention of goodness in the Qur'an primarily refers to the Messenger of God in its truest essence. Every mention of lesser goodness pertains to the first one who stood in opposition to the initial affirmation. If the term "earth of the Most High" is mentioned, it refers to His own essence, descending until it reaches the physical earth, which is the resting place of His body. All matters return to the Qa'im of the Family of Muhammad, upon Him be peace. All mentions of goodness in the Qur'an primarily pertain to Him, just as in the Bayán, they have been explained as referring to Him Whom God will make manifest.

Every mention of lesser goodness in the Qur'an, even if it involves the mention of "earth," refers to the earth of the essence of the first who did not turn towards Him. What is true in the Qur'an is likewise firmly established in the Bayán before God. Every name of goodness in God's knowledge pertains, in its primary essence, to the Point of Will, while those below it refer to the one who did not accept it. Just as every mention of "earth" in existence today refers to the Point of the Bayán.

The spirit descends from the earth of the spirit to the earth of the self, from the earth of the self to the earth of the body, and from the earth of the body to all things, approaching closer and closer until it reaches that earth above the mountain, a third of which is marked with "Sh" in four parts. This is the essence of all earthly terrains at that time, and the position changes according to the change in the matter until it stabilizes in that which does not change.

Thus, under the shadow of the Most High, letter corresponds to letter, and point corresponds to point. This is the highest earth of Ridván, and that is the lowest earth of the fire. I seek refuge in God from that which He does not love, and I ask God concerning all that He encompasses, for He is bountiful and generous.

How often have the names of goodness in the Qur'an been manifest, rank by rank, from the Messenger of God to each of His successors! Similarly, this pattern applies to those below the Most High, until it reaches the loftiest heights of the earth of paradise at the dwelling of the martyrdom of the Master of Martyrs, and the lowest depths of fire at the dwelling of the sovereignty of the self that opposes Him. This is the decree with God, and it applies similarly in the appearance of every one of the proofs of God.

Today, all names of goodness in their primary reality are encompassed in the essence of the Point, even the mention of the earth as exemplified. In their secondary reality, they are manifest in the letter "S," continuing until the ultimate limit of existence. So fear God, O people, all of you.

### Gate 6 (The Bayan Is the Balance Until the Day of Resurrection)

The sixth chapter of the second unity discusses how the Bayán is the balance of truth from God until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. Whoever adheres to it is in light, and whoever turns away from it is in fire.

The summary of this chapter is that the Bayán is the balance of truth until the Day of Resurrection, which is the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. Whoever acts in accordance with what is revealed with what is revealed in the Bayán is in paradise and under the shadow of steadfastness, and the letters of the Most High will be gathered before God. Whoever deviates, even by the measure of a mustard seed, will be in the fire and gathered under the shadow of negation. This truth is also evident in the Qur'an, where God has revealed on multiple occasions that whoever judges by other than what God has revealed is a disbeliever.

The implications of this word and its consequences are clear: whoever transgresses the decree of God is subject to His judgment. How much greater is the transgression when directed at the very Manifestation of God after He has revealed, "I have not created jinn and humankind except that they may worship Me." There is no doubt that obedience is not accepted unless it is obedience to the proof of God. Indeed, actions performed in opposition to the People of the House are mentioned before God, yet today, many claim that they had no worship and that their deeds bear no fruit. Similarly, those outside the Shi'a sect, though they act according to the Qur'an, their deeds are nullified before God due to their deviation from divine authority.

Today, few act in accordance with the balance of the Qur'an; in fact, such individuals are rarely seen, except by the will of God. Even if someone does adhere to it but does not enter the balance of the Bayán, their piety will bear no fruit, just as the piety of the monks of the Alif bore no fruit, despite their adherence to the balance during the time of the Manifestation of the Messenger of God. Had they acted according to the balance of the Qur'an, such judgments regarding the tree of truth would not have been made.

The heavens nearly split apart, the earth almost tears asunder, and the mountains nearly crumble from this. The hearts of these individuals are harder than these mountains and remain unaffected. There is no paradise greater or higher in the sight of God than being in His good pleasure. Praise be to Him, for today this bounty is exclusive to the people of the Bayán. Hereafter, whoever does not transgress its bounds will remain in this bounty until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. But should someone, God forbid, deviate, they have wronged none but themselves, for God is self-sufficient above all the worlds.

At the beginning of His manifestation, all of the Bayán is obedience to Him, and nothing else. Similarly, all religion during the Day of Alif, at the appearance of the Messenger of God, consisted of following Him, not merely adhering to the balance of their own understanding. For at that time, judgment against those who clung only to the balance of their past was issued. "Whoever is guided, it is for their own soul, and whoever veils themselves, it is against it. God is self-sufficient above all the worlds."

### Gate 7 (The Appearance of the Tree of Truth)

The seventh chapter of the second unity discusses the meaning of the Day of Resurrection. The summary of this chapter is that the Day of Resurrection refers to the Day of the appearance of the Tree of Truth. It is evident that none among the Shi'a has understood the Day of Resurrection; rather, all have imagined a concept that has no reality before God.

According to God and the understanding of the people of truth, the meaning of the Day of Resurrection is the period from the appearance of the Tree of Truth in any era until its setting. For example, the time from the Day of the mission of Jesus until His ascension was the Resurrection of Moses, during which the manifestation of God appeared in that era in the form of that Truth. During that time, everyone who believed in Moses was judged according to their own word, and whoever disbelieved was recompensed according to their own word, for what God testified in that era was what God testified in the Gospel.

From the time of the mission of the Messenger of God, may blessings and peace be upon Him and His family, until His ascension, it was the Resurrection of Jesus. The Tree of Truth appeared in the form of Muhammad, and He rewarded those who believed in Jesus and punished, according to His word, those who did not believe in Him. From the appearance of the Tree of the Bayán until its setting, it is the Resurrection of the Messenger of God, as God promised in the Qur'an.

The beginning of that day is calculated to be two hours and eleven minutes after the night of the fifth of Jumada al-Awwal in the year 1260, (May 23, 1844) which corresponds to the year 1270 of the mission. This marks the beginning of the Day of Resurrection for the Qur'an, which continues until the setting of the Tree of Truth. For anything to reach its Resurrection, it must first attain its station of perfection. The perfection of the religion of Islam concluded at the beginning of this appearance, and from that moment until its setting, the fruits of the Tree of Islam will be revealed.

The Resurrection of the Bayán will occur with the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, for today the Bayán is in its embryonic stage. At the beginning of His appearance, the ultimate perfection of the Bayán will be revealed, manifesting the fruits of the trees planted in it. Just as the appearance of the Qa'im of the Family of Muhammad mirrors the appearance of the Messenger of God, it does not occur except to gather the fruits of Islam from the Qur'anic verses planted in the hearts of the people.

The gathering of the fruits of Islam is nothing other than belief in Him and acknowledgment of Him. Yet today, the opposite has occurred, for during the zenith of Islam, He has appeared, and all proclaim Islam relative to Him. However, they exile Him unjustly to the mountain of Maku, even though in the Qur'an, God has promised all of creation the Day of Resurrection, for it is the day when all will be presented before God, which is to be presented before the Tree of Truth. All will attain the meeting with God, which is the meeting with Him, for presentation to the Most Sacred Essence is impossible, and direct encounter with Him is unimaginable. Whatever pertains to the presentation or meeting is related to the Primary Tree.

God has made clay His dwelling place, such that whoever on the Day of Resurrection is presented before the Tree of Truth and affirms this presentation will not be distant from encountering Him. Even a moment from the Day of Resurrection surpasses in value all the years that precede it, for the fruits of those years are manifested on the Day of Resurrection. Just as the fruits of 1,270 years of Islam became evident from the beginning of this manifestation until the end of this manifestation—which is the initial setting of the Sun of Truth—they will be fully revealed.

From the beginning of this manifestation to the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, the fruits of this cycle will pertain to another Resurrection, which will occur with His appearance. O people of the Bayán, have mercy on yourselves and do not nullify the length of your nights on the Day of Resurrection, as those veiled by the Qur'an have done. They prided themselves on Islam for 1,270 years, yet on the day when the fruits are gathered, which is the Day of Resurrection, judgment was rendered against them as being outside Islam, and they were invalidated by this very judgment until the next Resurrection.

How many souls from the beginning of their lives endured hardships and struggled for the pleasure of God, only to be dreaming while asleep and took pride in their dreams. Now, the Manifestation of God has appeared, clearer than any previous manifestation, with evident signs by which the religion of Islam is established. Presentation before God cannot occur unless the fruits of one’s faith are manifested in their rightful place, nor can creation fulfill its purpose if it does not rise to its intended station. Yet, they issue judgments against those who turn to God night and day, declaring, "You alone do we worship." Even if such individuals are content with this, it does not satisfy them, as they seek to bring sorrow to the friends of the Truth.

O people of the Bayán, do not act as the people of the Qur'an did, invalidating the fruits of your nights. If you, who believe in the Bayán, declare at the appearance of His signs, "God is our Lord, and we associate nothing with Him. This is what God has promised us of the Manifestation of His Self, and we call upon nothing besides Him," and if you obey Him in what He commands, you will have manifested the fruit of the Bayán. Otherwise, you are unworthy of mention before God.

Have mercy on yourselves; if you do not assist the Manifestation of Lordship, do not grieve Him. When He appears, creation will revert to a state like the one in which I now appear. Yet, it has not even crossed your hearts, apart from your faith, to hasten in responding to God and affirming His signs. For it is He Whom God will make manifest, whose words you must affirm. Do not veil yourselves from your Beloved in any matter, for if a decree is issued from His word, it will remain until the Day of Resurrection. In that Day, the people of paradise will enjoy their bliss in paradise, and the people of the fire will be tormented in the fire. Now that it is the Day of Resurrection, the place of judgment is this mountain. All act as they think pleases Him, yet they accept upon Him what they would not accept upon themselves.

If you were to make a covenant with your Lord to not accept for anyone what you do not accept for yourselves, perhaps in the next Resurrection, even if you do not attain the meeting with God, you would not have caused sorrow to His signs. The benefit of all those who follow the Bayán depends on your refraining from harming Him, though I know you will not abstain. Just as I, in this Resurrection, refrained from benefiting the followers of the Qur'an, you did not refrain from bringing harm.

No fire is more intense for you in the sight of God than to turn to me day and night in worship of God and then judge me in ways you would not accept for yourselves. But God will judge between me and you with justice, for He is the best of judges.

### Gate 8 (Death Has Infinite Meanings)

The eighth chapter of the second unity explains the reality of death and affirms its truth. The summary of this chapter is that death has infinite meanings in the sight of God, meanings that only He can encompass. One of these meanings in common understanding is the physical death perceived by all, which occurs at the moment the human soul is taken. Whatever is considered "death" in the sight of God is truth, and all who are accountable are obligated to acknowledge this.

It is true, not merely in the sense of the physical death understood by the people, but rather as death before the manifestation of the Tree of Truth, which pertains to what is beyond. This death is only realized in five stages: through the words **"There is no God but He,"** **"There is no God but I,"** **"There is no God but God,"** **"There is no God but You,"** or **"There is no God but the One in whom all are assured."**

The essence of death is that, at the moment of the manifestation of the Tree of Unity, represented by these five stages, all become "dead" by negating negation and affirming affirmation. To fully expound on this subtle mystery, which encompasses the seas of the heavens, the earth, and all that lies between them, would exceed the capacity of any ink or enumeration.

The core of the matter is this: whoever's will aligns entirely with the will of Him Whom God will make manifest, whose intent is none other than His intent, whose measure is His measure, whose decree is His decree, whose permission is His permission, whose term is His term, and whose Book is His Book—such a person truly comprehends death. For His will is the essence of God's will, His intent the essence of God's intent, His measure the essence of God's measure, His decree the essence of God's decree, His permission the essence of God's permission, His term the essence of God's term, and His Book the essence of God's Book.

Thus, in the Point of the Bayán, whoever "died" testified to the truth of death. Otherwise, no benefit accrued to them from what they recited in the Qur'an or supplications. How many have declared, "Death is true," yet their will deviated from His will, rendering them invalidated and exposing their false claims before God! This continues until the stage of the Book is reached, so that His Book, which was the very essence of the Book of God, was revealed to those who considered themselves the most learned of their time. Yet the pen is ashamed to record what they did, even though they would proclaim day and night that "death is true" and would act according to the Book prior to His, outwardly manifesting Islam and expending their knowledge. They claimed for themselves the rights God had ordained in the Qur'an for Him, though their own souls were not lawful for them, for they did not act out of faith in God. This is the fruit of knowledge without action in the Book of God.

Had they understood death, they would not have deviated from their own acknowledgment, testifying that it is true, while veiling themselves from the realities affirmed by that truth. This is the death that benefits all on the Day of Resurrection, and beyond that, in the intermediate world (barzakh), until God causes the Sun of Truth to rise.

What is meant by barzakh is the interval between two manifestations, not the common understanding of the state after the physical death of bodies. For this latter notion is below the responsibilities given to humanity, as what is decreed upon them after death is known only to God. What they are commanded in their lifetime, however, must be understood and acknowledged.

Whoever journeys in the ocean of death beholds endless wonders. For example, if someone had truly died during the time of the Messenger of God, they would have perceived that all realities pertaining to those who did not believe in Muhammad, from the realm of abstraction to the realm of limitation, were pure negation and absolute fire. Conversely, all realities pertaining to those who believed in Muhammad, from the realm of abstraction to the furthest limits of limitation, belonged to the Tree of Affirmation.

And the paradise of prophethood is established. The first was not "dead," as he was annihilated in negation, while the second was "dead," remaining steadfast in affirmation. Today, the fruits of the "death" of the believers are evident in how their mention is beloved before God and creation, and the abundance of believers arises from them. Conversely, the fruits of not "dying" among those beneath the believers are that no mention of them remains. Even if their numbers increased, they themselves would reject being associated with one another and would disavow such connections.

For today, if someone refrains from speaking of the first tree in opposition to the Truth, what was said of it would itself disavow them and seek God's wrath on their behalf. In the year 1270, as the Tree of Truth ascended, those opposing it descended further, becoming even more hardened. Yet, as the manifestations have varied, they cannot be discerned except by the proof that appears from God, for He alone knows all things in their proper places. If He wills, He can distinguish a particle of fire from a particle of paradise.

If a thought arises within a soul contrary to what is fitting for the Point of the Bayán, the judgment of "death" is not rendered upon it at the moment of its emergence. This matter is exceedingly subtle—indeed, even more subtle than this—and only those with insight can comprehend it. From the essence of the knowledge of divine unity, the attribution of "death" is valid to the ultimate station of limitation.

For example, if someone in the station of "Alif" finds the "Ba" where it does not belong, they correct and elevate it. This pertains to the functions of the Angel of Death, as such distinctions manifest from Him. And if the "Ba" is raised to its proper station, it continually calls upon its Lord, saying, "Take me and revive me." When God wills to answer its prayer, He inspires one of His chosen ones to remove from it the spirit of "Ba"-ness and bestow upon it the spirit of "Alif"-ness. Then, it becomes capable of true comprehension. Prior to this, the meaning of the word transforms, for "after God" is greater, as it pertains to "Alif." If the "Ba" is inscribed without its essence appearing, what is intended by it will remain hidden. It is like a vessel in both its macrocosmic and microcosmic dimensions, unperceived by those who observe, even if it rests upon parchment.

Should one inscribe upon it something inferior, it must be erased, for such a "death" grants life to that tablet. This is analogous to removing from the human self anything that harms its faith. If someone who does not believe in God possesses a tablet, one must declare, "I am dead," severing any connection to it and disregarding it entirely, for it belongs to the realm of fire and remains within it. Conversely, if a tablet is with one who believes in God, it must be preserved as one safeguards their own being, for it belongs to the realm of light.

The matter, when it is most apparent, is also the most concealed. One who understands death remains perpetually "dead" before God, willing nothing but what God wills. This is death before the Point of the Bayán, for nothing that God wills is revealed except through His decree. This is the true essence of death for those who desire to die in God.

In the realm of creation, God has created nothing more honored than death before Him. All aspire to align their will with the will of Him Whom God will make manifest. Yet when He appears, they fail to fulfill their love and claims, just as many who believed in the Qur'an elevated themselves to a station where, if Muhammad were to return to life, they would doubt His word. Indeed, He has returned in a form even more manifest than before.

At the beginning of His appearance, it is evident that this is the latter creation after the former. Those who declare that Muhammad is the Messenger of God all gathered yet did not affirm Him. They were unwilling to grant Him even what they desired for themselves in terms of being associated with Islam, nor did they attribute to Him the rights they claimed for themselves. This is something no Muslim would accept from another Muslim. Such is the condition of creation before God.

If His prophethood had been established beforehand, they would affirm it. Yet all remain veiled, countless in number, claiming adherence to His religion but not believing in Him upon His return, except those whom God wills. This persisted until what was to appear became manifest. For those who do not recognize Him, no fire is more intense than the veils they place between themselves and Him, the One who made Islam their religion and the Qur'an their Book. Yet He has no greater honor than that He attained the meeting with His Lord, conveyed His messages, and turned entirely to Him with all that was within His power. This is the true honor in which all should take pride.

If someone were to say, "We did not recognize Him at the beginning of His appearance," the response would be: It is universally known among all who perceive reality that He was the first to respond in the preexistent world when God asked, "Am I not your Lord?" He said, "Yes, glorified are You! There is no God but You; You are the Lord of all worlds."

If they claim that they did not recognize the Manifestation of God, the Qur'an, being the Book of God, was present among all and acknowledged as such. When they heard or saw that the signs of God were manifest from a soul, no doubt could remain in the hearts of those with perception that this soul was the Manifestation of God. The signs before Him were His, just as the signs after Him belong to Him.

And whoever responds first is the first creation, just as it was previously said that the first to respond was Muhammad, and he was the first creation. This remains acknowledged today. If they assert that the first response occurred through him, then he is the primordial essence, for above the throne of the heavens is indeed the place of the Manifestation of God. God has eternally and will eternally remain equidistant to all things; neither proximity nor distance applies to Him uniquely among all creation. No thing is nearer to Him nor farther than any other, whether the throne is above the heavens, as imagined by those who speculate, or it is the station of the Tree that speaks by the command of God.

Such beliefs are mere delusion and imagination. In the understanding of the inhabitants of the realm of truth, "place" refers to the site of manifestation. For example, all who visit the shrine of the Master of Martyrs affirm what is recorded in tradition: "Whoever visits Husayn, upon him be peace, recognizing his station, it is as though they have visited God above His throne." Among those with insight, it is evident that this is the station of the Throne of God and the Throne of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, may peace and blessings be upon Him and His family.

It seems as though no one has ascended from the realm of limitation, for all realities heard across the realms become embodied in this world. Just as in this world the Commander of the Faithful, upon him be peace, was the first to believe in Muhammad, this proves that he was a believer across all realms. All realms are actualized under the shadow of this world and manifest here before those with insight. Blessed is the one who perceives all things as they truly are and does not imagine delusory matters that have no reality before God or the people of insight.

The divine essence has eternally existed and will eternally remain, whether manifest as the inner or the outer, or as the outer or the inner. Whatever is mentioned regarding the manifestation of God refers to the Tree of Truth, which signifies nothing but Him. This Tree is the one that has sent forth all the messengers and revealed all the scriptures, eternally existing as the throne of His manifestation and concealment. It has always been among the people, manifesting in each age according to His will.

For instance, during the revelation of the Qur'an, He manifested His power through Muhammad, and during the revelation of the Bayán, He manifested His power through the Point of the Bayán. At the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, He will affirm His religion in whatever manner He wills, by whatever means He wills, for whatever purpose He wills. He is the one who has always been with all things, yet nothing has been with Him. He is not within things, not above things, and not alongside things.

When His "sitting" upon the throne is mentioned, it signifies the manifestation of His power, not a physical throne or chair above the earth, nor the celestial or terrestrial spheres that have existed eternally. None has known Him, nor will anyone know Him, for everything below Him is created by His command, and they continue to be created by His command. He is exalted beyond any description or praise, sanctified from any attribute or example. Nothing perceives Him, yet He perceives all things.

Even the statement that "nothing perceives Him" ultimately relates to the manifestation of His appearance, which is Him Whom God will make manifest. He is the most exalted and the most supreme.

No one capable of pointing can gesture toward Him. Him Whom God will make manifest is the first of His creation, and the mention of the pronoun referring to Him returns to His heart, for both He and His heart are His creation. God has eternally been Lord without being lorded over, eternally been God without being worshiped, eternally been powerful without any power exercised over Him, eternally been knowledgeable without anything known to Him, and eternally been one without being numerable.

The statement **"God has eternally been one without being numerable"** pertains to the time when, at the manifestation of Him Whom God will make manifest, one individual believes in Him. The hearts of these believers testify to His oneness, and there are no others counted among them. Similarly, all names and attributes are understood in this way, without being confined by limits.

Do not focus on boundaries, for **"God has eternally been one"** holds true whether or not you are a believer in this manifestation. If you are not a believer now, consider the first manifestation: look to the Messenger of God, where you can observe all names and attributes. If you wish to say, **"He is a sovereign,"** you will see among His community those who consider themselves mere servants of His. Yet the sovereignty of His essence transcends association with this earthly sovereignty.

If you wish to say, **"He is mighty,"** you will observe those with insight honoring Him by expressing their pride in belonging to His community. Yet the might of His essence is far above association with this might. If you wish to say, **"He is knowledgeable,"** you will find those endowed with knowledge taking pride in their connection to Him. Yet the knowledge of His essence transcends any connection to this knowledge of these learned ones. If you wish to say, **"He is a ruler,"** you will observe many possessors of authority who take pride in their rulership under His command. Yet the rulership of His essence transcends any association with these manifestations of rulership from Him.

Similarly, observe all names and attributes in their reality. When a servant is knowledgeable, there is no knowledge except His. When a servant is capable of an action, there is no power except His. In every manifestation, all who are guided by that appearance are but aspects of Him. For instance, if you consider the first manifestation, Adam the first, to the infinite, nothing exists except through God. One cannot truly recognize the manifestation of divinity except through the Tree of His appearance, which is His primal will. Beyond this, recognition is impossible, for such is the nature of possibility.

This is the meaning of the statement of the Master of Martyrs, upon Him be peace: **"O my God, through the variation of traces and the transformations of states, I have come to know that Your purpose for me is that I recognize You in all things, so that I may not be ignorant of You in anything."** For this is the fruit of the existence of all things: that all things recognize their being as established through the primal will and see nothing in anything except the manifestation of God, to the extent that the essence of each thing bears His appearance. Beyond this, the association of His manifestation is equal in relation to all things.

The signs of God manifest in one type of appearance, and from the same source from which the signs of God originate, they descend into the prophethood of a prophet and, below that, to whatever is fitting. The relationship of His manifestation to these two aspects is equal, except that one arises from the highest heights of affirmation, while the other descends from the lowest depths of negation.

If you consider this meaning in a word during one manifestation, you will perceive it in the essence of another. However, the intent is not to observe the essence of God in all things, for this is impossible. He, exalted is His mention, is beyond being within anything, with anything, before anything, after anything, above anything, or below anything. What gives reality to the existence of all things is His will, which is itself self-sustaining. He has eternally been, and will eternally remain, as all names exist under His shadow, while He is established in the shadow of God.

The station of will is the station of the Point of the Bayán, which does not manifest in anything except as an aspect of the appearances of His command. The meaning is not that the essence of the will, which is the essence of the Messenger of God, is seen in all things. Rather, it is observed in all things that their reality is established through Him.

For example, if a person were to spend a thousand measures of gold for the sake of the House of God, what would be seen in this act is nothing but the command that the Messenger of God had given on behalf of God. Similarly, if you ask how the essence of gold comes into existence, it must necessarily relate to an aspect that ultimately returns to the Tree of Truth, even if it manifests in one of His manifestations.

No thing can be described as having "existence" unless its reality is established through His will. He is self-sustaining through God, the Mighty and Glorious. He is the encompassing circle, eternally revolving around Himself. He signifies and will always signify nothing but God, exalted and glorified, to whom belong the most excellent names in the kingdom of the heavens, the earth and all that lies between them. There is no God but He, the Mighty, the Beloved. For every name, there is a reality it refers to. For example, if it is said that God, exalted and glorified, is the All-Mighty, then there must necessarily be two manifestations that, in the presence of His primal will, are mentioned and eternally established, signifying none but Him.

Blessed is the one who sees in every thing only the manifestation of their Lord, who rests in nothing except in God, who perceives nothing but Him, and who does not attribute to God what is attributed to His creation. For God, glorified is He, is not within anything, nor of anything, nor upon anything, nor toward anything, nor mentioned by anything. All things beneath Him are created for Him. None but He can comprehend His essence, and none but He can recognize His oneness in His essence.

The will only knows itself, and all that creation perceives is what the will manifests within them. God, exalted and glorified, in His essence, cannot be known, perceived, celebrated, or sanctified. None can approach Him except by recognizing their inability to comprehend Him and by abiding in the shadow of His oneness and independence.

Everything exists through Him in its reality, essence, substance, abstraction, beginning, end, outwardness, inwardness, purity, and harmony. He is at the highest heights of His sovereign power and the most exalted summit of His sacred kingship. He is beyond all description and praise, sanctified above every attribute and eminence.

Eternally, God has been God—one, unique, self-sufficient, eternal, everlasting, alive, sustaining, and independent. He has neither taken a consort nor begotten a child. All beneath Him is His creation, brought into being by His command. He has eternally been and will eternally remain self-sufficient through Himself. How, then, could He not be independent of all else and self-reliant in His essence? How, then, could He not be independent of all others? Glorified and exalted is He as befitting the loftiness of His sanctity and the exaltation of His mention. Verily, He has always been the Most High, the Most Exalted.

### Gate 9 (The Resurrection of Every Soul)

The ninth chapter of the second unity discusses the reality of the grave. The summary of this chapter is that for every soul, a grave is appointed within the bounds of its station, and all are brought to their ultimate end at the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest. His resurrection is the resurrection of all; His gathering is the gathering of all; His creation is the creation of all; and His emergence from His grave is the emergence of all from their own graves.

For example, in the Point of the Bayán, when the Manifestation of Divinity raised up the Messenger of God from His own essence, He raised all those who were to be gathered under His shadow. Likewise, upon the earth today, whatever judgment is issued in relation to the religion of Islam will, by extension, apply to His religion.

All true souls guided by the Bayán are referred back to the primal essence, which, on the Day of Resurrection, was the first to respond to God's command and to acknowledge His oneness. Conversely, all souls lacking truth are referred back to the Tree of Negation at the time of His manifestation. Similarly, when the Messenger of God was raised, all souls beneath the shadow of the Qur'an were resurrected under His shadow. As the Tree of Affirmation was elevated, all true souls were elevated under it.

This does not mean that one soul becomes connected to another, but rather that all remain within the stations of their respective realms. For instance, the letters of "Hay" remain within the stations of their hearts, and at the first resurrection, they are resurrected according to their designated positions. It is not that their souls surpass the bounds of their stations. Likewise, the believers who exist under the shadow of these letters remain within their respective realms. The grave in which all are questioned pertains to their essential capacities. They are questioned in the first mention until the limitless realities are fully elucidated.

Similarly, those under the shadow of the Tree of Negation are questioned regarding what is beneath the goodness encompassed by God's knowledge. This is the meaning of the apparent tradition that, on the Day of Resurrection, the Commander of the Faithful, upon him be peace, will stand on the path before God and proclaim: **"Whatever goodness exists is from me,"** while the second of the letters of negation will confess: **"Whatever evil exists is from me."**

The realms of goodness are infinitely abundant in the divine dominion, as are the realms of the oppositional realms. For example, if for a thousand years one soul causes sorrow to another, it is due to the sorrow inflicted by the second letter of negation during the first manifestation. All multiplied aspects of negation refer back to it, while all affirmed aspects of goodness refer back to the first who believed, who in turn refers to God.

If God does not raise Him up, He will not rise of His own essence. The Tree of Negation, too, in its own bounds, ultimately refers back to God. For if God does not raise it up, it remains in its initial state, knowing nothing of itself or others.

This is the comprehensive grave encompassing the diverse aspects of all souls. Each day, every soul is questioned about its faith in God and His signs in the Bayán. If the soul responds, its grave is filled withvlight, and the angels of mercy descend upon it. However, if the soul does not respond, its grave becomes filled with fire, and the manifestations of wrath descend upon it. This occurs within the particular soul because it is an aspect of the comprehensive fiery essence. Likewise, the one who responds to truth is an aspect of the comprehensive luminous essence. For such a soul, a herald and bringer of glad tidings are mentioned, while for others, the opposite applies.

This is the reason every soul benefits from acknowledging that the grave is true. For if a soul belongs to the higher realms of the Most High, it returns to Him and is then separated from Him in another sign—not because its essence becomes His essence, but as a progression. Just as those who believed in the Book of Alif returned to their faith in the Book of Qaf, their creation spread, and they were nurtured within the religion of Islam. Gradually, this continued until their time culminated with the Day of the revelation of the Bayán. They returned to it, and from it, their creation spread among another people until God willed otherwise.

In this paradise, they grow and flourish until the Day of Him Whom God will make manifest. Then, they will return to His Book, and from it, they will spread among another creation until God wills otherwise, for there is no limit to God's bounty. Similarly, if a soul under the shadow of the letters of Alif does not believe, it returns to the first of those who did not believe in the Messenger of God. From there, it becomes separated and descends to the lower realms beneath the Most High of the Bayán.

It remains in a station of ultimate negation until it returns to the first letter of negation in the Bayán. Afterward, it becomes separated again and proceeds toward its own annihilation until it ultimately returns to the first who disbelieved in Him Whom God will make manifest. Then it separates further, and in all these realms, its garment becomes fire. Even if it be adorned with silk, its station becomes fire, even if it is in the loftiest places above the earth. Its sustenance will be of the same nature. Conversely, the garment of those beneath that station, who are created for paradise, transforms their abode into the highest chambers of Ridván. Their food becomes the choicest fruits of paradise, even if their clothing is made only of cotton, their seat is but the dust of the earth, and they consume nothing more than lettuce leaves.

There is no soul of a believer whose spirit is taken except that their grave becomes a meadow from the gardens of the eternal paradise. Whatever they desire, God creates for them there, and it is pure before them. Similarly, there is no soul that does not believe in the Bayán except that the pen is incapable of describing the divine wrath that befalls them.

If one wishes to observe in this world the bounty bestowed upon the Tree of Affirmation, they may perceive the countless realities emanating from it, with every soul receiving from it according to what God has granted. Conversely, if they wish to witness the wrath of God, they may consider what has been revealed concerning the Tree of Negation, whose countless realities are tormented in proportion to its essence, just as the countless realities of the Most High are blessed in proportion to theirs.

This is the explanation of the reality of the grave. Few are found who truly understand the truth of it and recognize the grave as a reality. Whoever has comprehended the Bayán of God regarding the truth has also affirmed that **"the grave is true."**

No spirit transcends the bounds of its station. For instance, a spirit that pertains to creation has eternally been of creation, while a spirit connected to truth has eternally been of truth. A spirit that serves as a sign of God has eternally been a sign, without bounds or limitations. No soul passes at the moment of death without God, the All-Knowing, exalted in His sovereignty, commanding the angels who are purified, sanctified, and glorifiers of His oneness and majesty to elevate that soul to the highest station of paradise and the loftiest horizon of Ridván. Such a soul will experience no sorrow after death if they were a believer in what God revealed in the Bayán until the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest.

The first appearance will not be acceptable to those who pass without faith in the Bayán, for the breezes of paradise will not reach them. Similarly, if a soul, after the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, hesitates even as much as to say "yes" or to gesture in acknowledgment of His truth, the Bayán will yield no fruit for them. No soul that departs without belief in the Bayán will taste even the smallest degree of goodness or beauty after death. The pen trembles to describe what has been prepared for such a soul.

Blessed is the one whose spirit is taken while believing in Him Whom God will make manifest and His words, for such a person is a believer in the Bayán and all that it contains. The grace of God toward the believers has no bounds or limits. Eternally, the people of paradise belong to paradise, except for those whom God wills, just as the people of the Qur'an belonged to the Qur'an, except for those whom God willed at the appearance of the Bayán by the will of the Point of the Bayán, which is the will of God. The people of the fire remain in the fire eternally, except for those whom God wills. This will becomes evident at the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, as understood by those endowed with knowledge.

For example, the people of the Gospel, prior to the mission of the Messenger of God, were in paradise if they acted according to what God had revealed. However, at the time of His mission, they were judged to be in the fire unless they were guided during that time by God's will. For such souls, it is said that they were saved from the fire and entered paradise. Similarly, the believers in the Qur'an and what was revealed within it are in paradise, except for those whom God wills otherwise. This occurs if any of those believers fail to recognize the Bayán, for they then enter the fire and leave paradise.

Eternally, the universal manifestation of the divine will appears in every Resurrection and ascends. During the rising of the night, which refers to the period of intermission (barzakh), the divine will becomes concealed. God admits whom He wills into His paradise and prevents whom He wills from entering it. None knows this except for those who transgress the bounds of the Bayán, at which point their will aligns with a will from the previous manifestation. Otherwise, God is always in a state of action in every moment.

The universal manifestation of the divine will in the intermission may open for the witnesses of the previous cycle a door of knowledge that they are unable to bear. This has been the case from the beginning of the appearance of the Messenger of God until His mission. Similarly, prior to this appearance, from the ascension of Jesus, this matter remained veiled. From the passing of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon Him and His family, until the initial revelation of the Bayán, the divine will was concealed among the people and none could recognize Him, for He has eternally remained in the station of the primal Point and continues to do so. The Letters of Life dwell within their stations, as do the other letters of the Most High and those beneath them, each in their respective places. All draw sustenance from Him, yet while He knows all, none can know Him. However, whoever turns wholly toward Him is inevitably granted assistance in ways they do not perceive, for He is the All-Powerful, the Most Glorious, the All-Knowing.

### Gate 10 (The Questioning of Angels)

The tenth chapter of the second unity explains the questioning of the angels in the grave. The summary of this chapter is that on the Day of Resurrection, the believers in Him Whom God will make manifest will ask people, "Upon what is your religion established?" They will respond, "Upon the authority of the Bayán." If on that day they are believers in the signs of God, they will answer the angels based on the authority God revealed before and taught them. Otherwise, God's proof will be completed against them.

If they do not believe, the word of wrath is decreed against them. Afterward, the angels return to the presence of God, reporting the state of these individuals. If they respond with faith, then the verses of mercy are revealed upon them. If not, the words of wrath are established, and whatever God decrees for them on that day will be carried out.

For instance, whatever the Point of the Bayán decreed concerning anyone will remain established until the Day of Resurrection. The manifestations of negation will abide in the fire, while the manifestations of light will remain in affirmation. The former will suffer in the depths beneath the Letters of the Most High, while the latter will eternally abide in God's mercy, granted within the Letters of the Most High. This is a favor...
