# **Lawh-i-Baytu'l-'Adl (Tablet of the House of Justice)** {#sec-lawh-i-baytul-adl .unnumbered}

1 He is the ruler over what He wills. It has been written for every city to establish a House of Justice in it and for souls to gather in it by the number of splendor, and if it increases, there is no harm. They feel as if they are entering the presence of God, the Most High, the Highest, and they see what is unseen. They ought to be the trustees of the Merciful among the people of the world, and his representatives for everyone on Earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants for the sake of God, just as they consult on their affairs, and they should choose what is best. Thus is the command of your Lord, the Mighty, the Forgiver.

2 Jamal Kadam, addressing the nations, says: In every city of the cities of the earth, they should build a house in the name of justice. In that house, gather the pure and tranquil souls in the number of the Greatest Name, and those souls, while present, should observe as if they are in the presence of Allah. For this firm command has been issued from the pen of the past, and the attention of Allah is directed towards that assembly.

3 And after entering, my agency should speak on behalf of the souls in matters and interests of all. For example, in proclaiming the command of Allah first, as this command is the most important of matters, so that every single soul may enter the tent of unity, and all who are on earth are seen as one structure. They should also observe the etiquette of souls, preserving their dignity, rebuilding the lands, and the politics that Allah has made the foundation of the lands and a safeguard for the servants.

4 And the proclamation of the command of Allah should be considered in light of the times and ages, how it is beneficial, and so should other matters, and they should implement it. However, be careful not to oppose what has been revealed in the divine verses in this manifestation of the Almighty, for the truth is that what He has determined is indeed the welfare of the servants. Indeed, He is more merciful to you than you are to yourselves. Indeed, He is the Knowing, the Aware.

5 And if the mentioned souls act according to the established conditions, they will certainly be supported by unseen blessings. This is something that will benefit everyone. There are many matters that, if neglected, will be wasted and become void. Consider the many children observed on earth without a father and mother. If no attention is given to their education and development, they will remain fruitless. The death of a fruitless soul is more preferable than its life. Similarly, for the wealthy and honorable who, due to weakness, old age, or some other issue, have fallen into poverty and humiliation, all these matters, and others related to the earth, should be thought over and contemplated by these souls for the sake of Allah, and whatever is right should be implemented.

6 If the servants look towards their hearts, they will certainly realize that what has been revealed from the source of command is purely for the good of everyone on Earth. Everyone should be like wings for each other. The honor of a human lies in wisdom, intellect, and good morals, not in the accumulation of ornaments, arrogance, and pride. Everyone is created from dust and to it they will return. O people of Baha, the adornment of a human being is not due to the means of this world, but rather it lies in the recognition of the Truth, in sciences, in arts, and in good manners.

7 You are the pearls in the sea of Oneness. Observe that the purity and dignity of a pearl is in its own essence. If you put it in many fine silks, those silks would obstruct the display of its freshness and delicacy. Its adornment is in its own essence. Strive to achieve this adornment, and do not be saddened by the lack of external means.

8 O trees of paradise, do not shield yourselves from the divine spring breezes, and do not deprive yourselves of the fragrances of the divine commandments. Pay attention to the position that, despite the ignorance of all and this great tribulation in the prison of Akka, what was ordained from the splendid Pen is for the good of His servants. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
