# **Lawh-i-Baytu'l-'Adl (Tablet of the Houses of Justice)** {#sec-lawh-i-baytul-adl .unnumbered}

1 He is the Sovereign over whatever He wills.

It has been decreed that in every city a House of Justice should be established, and a number of souls equivalent to the number of Bahá should gather therein. If the number increases, there is no harm. They should perceive themselves as if they are entering the presence of God, the Most High, the Exalted, and behold Him who is unseen. They should be the trusted ones of the Merciful among the people of the world, and His agents for all who are on earth. They should consult on the welfare of the servants for the sake of God, just as they consult on their own affairs, and they should choose what is most fitting. Thus has your Lord, the Mighty, the All-Forgiving, commanded.

2 The Beauty of the Ancient, addressing the nations, declares: In every city among the cities of the earth, let a House be established in the name of Justice. In that House, a number of pure, trustworthy souls, equivalent to the Greatest Name, should gather. When those souls are present, they should consider themselves as if they are in the presence of God, for this firm decree has been issued from the Pen of the Ancient, and the gaze of God is directed towards that assembly.

3 And after entering, they should discuss the affairs and interests of all with the authority given by the people. For example, first, in the propagation of the Cause of God, for this is the most important matter, so that all may enter the canopy of Oneness as if they were one soul, and that all who are on earth may be seen as one body. Likewise, they should consider the morals of souls, the preservation of honor, the development of cities, and the governance that God has ordained as the foundation for the lands and a protection for the servants.

4 And the propagation of the Cause of God should be considered in accordance with the conditions of the times and ages, observing how it is most beneficial. Likewise, other matters should be considered and carried out accordingly. However, be mindful not to act contrary to what has been revealed in the divine verses in this mighty, eternal Manifestation, for whatever the True One—exalted is His station—has decreed is indeed what is best for the servants. Verily, He is more merciful to you than you are to yourselves. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

5 And if the aforementioned souls act according to the prescribed conditions, they will undoubtedly be aided by unseen favors. This is a matter whose benefits will return to all. There are many affairs which, if not given attention, will be wasted and lost. How many children are seen on the earth without father or mother; if no attention is given to their education and training, they will remain fruitless. A fruitless soul is better off dead than alive. Likewise, regarding the wealthy and the honored who, due to weakness, old age, or some other cause, have fallen into poverty and humiliation, it is necessary that these souls, for the sake of God, reflect and deliberate on all such matters and affairs related to the earth and carry out what is right.

6 If the servants were to turn their gaze toward the heart, they would certainly know that whatever has been revealed from the Source of the Cause is purely for the benefit of all who are on earth. All should be as wings for one another. The true pride of a human being lies in wisdom, intellect, and good character, not in the accumulation of worldly ornaments, arrogance, or pride. All are created from dust and to it shall return. O people of Bahá, the adornment of a person is not through the means of the world, but through the recognition of the True One, exalted is His majesty, as well as through knowledge, crafts, and manners.

7 You are the pearls of the ocean of Oneness. Consider the pearl: its purity and dignity are inherent to itself. If it is wrapped in the finest silks, those silks would obstruct the manifestations of its freshness and delicacy. Its adornment is in itself. Attain this adornment, and do not be saddened by the lack of outward means.

8 O trees of the Paradise of God, do not withhold yourselves from the divine spring breezes, and do not deprive yourselves of the fragrances of the divine words of wisdom. This is a favor at a time when all are heedless, and this great affliction has been revealed by the Most Glorious Pen while in the prison of 'Akká, what is best for His servants. Verily, He is the All-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.
