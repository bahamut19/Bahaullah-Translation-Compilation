# **Salat-i-Saghir (The Small Prayer)** {#sec-salat-i-saghir .unnumbered}

*To be recited once every twenty-four hours, at midday:*

1 I bear witness, O my God, that You have created me to know You and to worship You. I bear witness at this moment to my powerlessness and Your might, to my weakness and Your strength, to my poverty and Your wealth. There is no God but You, the Sovereign, the Self-Subsisting.
