# Salat-i-Saghir (The Small Prayer) {#sec-salat-i-saghir .unnumbered}

*To be recited once every twenty-four hours, at midday:*

1 I bear witness, O my God, that You have created me for the knowledge of You and for Your worship. I testify at this moment to my powerlessness and to Your power, my weakness and Your authority, my poverty and Your wealth. There is no god but You, the All-Controlling, the Ever-Sustaining.
