The Verse of the Bayan:
"If We were to reveal this Bayán to those in the dominion of the heavens and the earth 
and all that is between them, then all, by their Lord, the Merciful, would believe. 
God, there is no God but Him—the Living, the Watchful, the Self-Subsisting. God, there 
is no God but Him—the Overpowering, the Manifest, the Unique, the Inaccessible, 
the Exalted, the Holy. His are the most excellent names. All in the heavens and the 
earth and all that is between them glorify Him. Glorified and exalted is He above what 
they describe. Say: Verily, God, He is the Sovereign, the Supreme Ruler, 
the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing. His are the highest attributes, and all in the 
heavens and the earth and all that is between them prostrate to Him, for He is the 
Mighty, the Beloved."
