O Most Great Branch! By the life of God, your afflictions have distressed me, but God will heal you and protect you. He is indeed the Best of the Generous and the most excellent Helper.

The Glory be upon you and upon those who serve you and circle around you, and woe and torment be upon those who oppose you and harm you. Blessed is the one who befriends you, and the fire of hell for the one who opposes you.
