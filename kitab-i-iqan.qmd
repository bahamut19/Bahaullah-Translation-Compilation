## Part One: Rejection of the Manifestations of God {#sec-part-one-rejection-of-the-manifestations-of-god}

In the name of our Lord, the Most High, the Most Great.

1 The door mentioned in the statement that the servants will not reach the shore of the sea of knowledge except by completely cutting off from everything in the heavens and the earth. Purify yourselves, O people of the earth, so that you may reach the position that God has destined for you, and enter into a pavilion that God has raised in the sky of explanation.

2 The essence of this door is that seekers on the path of faith and those who seek the cups of certainty must purify and sanctify their souls from all incidental matters, meaning they must turn their ears away from hearing sayings, their hearts from thoughts related to the glories of majesty, their spirits from attachment to apparent causes, and their eyes from observing perishable words. They should rely on God and seek refuge in Him, so that they become capable of manifesting the illuminations of the suns of divine knowledge and gnosis, and become the place for the appearances of the outpourings of the infinite unseen. Because if a servant wants to gauge the sayings, deeds, and actions of servants, both knowledgeable and ignorant, by the standard of true recognition of God and His friends, he will never enter into the pleasure of the knowledge of the Lord of Might, will not reach the destination of eternal life, and will not be blessed with the cup of nearness and pleasure.

3 Look back to previous times when people, high and low, were always waiting for the manifestations of oneness in holy temples, to such an extent that they were watchful and waiting at all times and moments, making prayers and pleas, hoping that the breeze of divine mercy might start to blow and that the promised beauty would step from the pavilion of the unseen into the arena of appearance. And when the doors of favor opened, and the cloud of honor was raised, and the sun of the unseen was manifested on the horizon of power, they all started to deny it and sought to avoid meeting Him, which is like meeting God. This is detailed in all heavenly books.

4 Now, consider for a moment what was the cause of people's objection after their pursuit and hopes. They objected in such a way that all tongues, expression, and writing are incapable and inadequate to mention it. No one appeared from the holy manifestations and studied oneness without being afflicted with the objections, denials, and disputes of people. As it says, "Alas for the servants! Never does a messenger come to them but they mock him." And in another place it says, "And every nation plotted against their messenger to seize him, and they disputed by means of falsehood to refute the truth thereby."

5 Similarly, the words that have descended from the cloud of Absolute Power and the sky of Divine Glory are beyond the count and comprehension of servants. For those with understanding hearts and insight, Surah Hud is sufficient. Contemplate a little on that blessed Surah, and consider it with your innate nature, so you might gain some knowledge of the wonders of the affairs of the prophets and the denial and rejection of the divine words. Perhaps you may guide people from the dwelling place of worldly negligence to the abode of unity and divine knowledge, to sip from the ever-flowing stream of wisdom and the fruits of the tree of knowledge of the Majestic, and become blessed. This is the portion of the souls detached from the eternal holy feast.

6 If you become aware of the trials of the prophets and the cause and reason for the objections of servants to those suns of essence, you will become informed about most matters, and the more you observe the objections of people to the dawning places of the suns of oneness, the stronger and more steadfast you will become in your faith and in the cause of God. Therefore, some stories of the prophets are briefly mentioned in these tablets so that it becomes known and proves that in all ages and eras, they brought to the manifestations of power and the study of majesty what the pen is too shy and inactive to mention. Perhaps these remembrances will prevent some people from being disturbed by the aversions and objections of the scholars and the ignorant of the age, and instead increase their certainty and assurance.

7 Among the prophets was Noah, who lamented for nine hundred and fifty years, inviting servants to the secure valley of the spirit, and no one responded to him. Every day they inflicted so much harm and injury on that blessed being that they were certain of his destruction. What levels of mockery, ridicule, and insinuation were inflicted upon him, as it is said: "And whenever an assembly of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, 'If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule. So you will know.'" And after periods, he promised his companions the descent of victory several times at a specified promise, and at each level, it seemed to fail. Some of the few companions turned away due to the appearance of failure, as detailed in most famous books, and certainly it is or will be apparent to the exalted perspective. Until nothing remained for him but forty souls or seventy-two souls as mentioned in the books and reports. Until finally the cry, "Lord, do not leave any of the disbelievers on the earth." was drawn from his soul.

8 Now you must ponder why, during this period, these servants protested in this way and sought avoidance, and did not take pride and succeed in removing the shirt of negation to affirmation? And why did the divine promises appear to fail, causing some of the receptive ones to turn away? You must reflect greatly to become aware of the mysteries of the unseen matters, and catch a spiritual scent from the true rose garden, and affirm that divine trials have always been and will always be among His servants so that light may be distinguished from darkness, truth from falsehood, guidance from misguidance, happiness from misery, and thorns from flowers. As He said, "Did people think that they would be left alone because they say, 'We believe,' and not be tested?"

9 And after Noah, the beauty of Hud shone forth from the sunrise of creation, and for nearly seven hundred years or more, according to differing accounts, he invited the people to the good-pleasure of the Lord of Majesty. And what a multitude of tribulations rained down upon him like a pouring rain, until the multitude of his calls led to the multitude of their avoidance, and the intensity of his concern became the cause for the intensity of their closing their eyes. "And nothing does their disbelief increase the disbelievers in but loss."

10 And after this, the edifice of Salih emerged from the spiritual and unseen good-pleasure, inviting the servants to the enduring laws of nearness, and for a hundred years or more he commanded the divine orders and forbade the prohibitions, but it bore no fruit and no effect appeared. And he chose to be absent several times, even though that eternal beauty was calling the people to nothing but the city of divine unity. As he says: "And to Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him" to the end of the verse: "They said: O Salih! you were one amongst us in whom great expectations were placed before this; do you forbid us that we should serve what our fathers served and we are surely in disquieting doubt with respect to that to which you invite us." And it granted no benefit until they all returned to the fire with a single cry.

11 And afterwards, the beauty of Abraham lifted the veil and the flag of guidance was raised, inviting the people of the earth to the light of piety. Regardless of how much he emphasized his advice, it bore no fruit but envy and gave no gain but heedlessness, except for those who were totally detached towards God and ascended on the wings of certitude to a station that God has set beyond understanding. The details of his life are well-known, showing the extent to which enemies surrounded him until the fire of envy and aversion was ignited. And after the story of the fire, they expelled that divine lamp from their land, as is mentioned in all epistles and books.

12 And afterwards, when Abraham's time had passed, it was Moses' turn. He appeared on the scene of manifestation from the divine love of Pharaoh with the staff of command and the white hand of knowledge. With the serpent of divine power and majesty from the Sinai of light, he invited all those in the kingdom to the everlasting kingdom and the fruits of the tree of loyalty. It was heard how Pharaoh and his entourage objected, and how much the stones of suspicions from the idolatrous souls were cast at that blessed tree. To the extent that Pharaoh and his entourage conspired to extinguish the divine Lote Tree with the water of denial and aversion, ignorant of the fact that the fire of divine wisdom is not extinguished by elemental water, and the lamp of divine power is not extinguished by opposing winds. Rather, in this station, water is the cause of ignition, and wind is the reason for preserving the flame, if you perceive with the vision of certainty and tread on God's pleasure. And how eloquently did the believer from Pharaoh's family speak, as God the Almighty narrates his story to His beloved: "And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said: 'Are you going to kill a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah,' while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? If he is a liar, then upon him is his lie; but if he is truthful, then some of what he promises you will befall you. Indeed, Allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar.'" And in the end, the matter led to the martyrdom of this believer under the severest of tortures. May the curse of Allah be upon the wrongdoers.

13 Now, reflect a little on these matters, what could have caused these differences, so that with each Divine Manifestation which appeared in the realm of possibility from the horizon of impossibility, such turmoil, chaos, injustice, and upheaval would be seen throughout the world? Despite the fact that all the prophets, during their appearances, gave glad tidings to the people of the coming prophet and mentioned a sign of the next manifestation, as is recorded in all the scriptures. Despite people's desire and anticipation for holy appearances and the mention of signs in the books, why should such events occur in the world that all prophets and chosen ones in every covenant and age are subjected to such oppression, coercion, and aggression? As He says: "Then is it that whenever there came to you a messenger with what your souls did not desire, you grew arrogant? So a party \[of messengers\] you denied and another party you killed." He says, every time and age when a messenger came to you from the Lord with something against your lower desires, you grew arrogant and didn't become convinced, and you denied a group of those prophets, and a group you killed.

14 In conclusion, ponder over this: what was the cause of such actions that they would behave in such a way towards the dawning of the beauty of the All-Glorious? And whatever was the cause of the aversion and indignation of those servants at that time is now the cause of the heedlessness of these servants. If we were to say that the Divine Proofs were not complete and perfect, and therefore the cause of the objection of the servants, this would be explicit disbelief. Because it is far from the overflowing grace and expansive mercy of God to select a soul from among all His servants to guide His creation, and yet not grant him sufficient and complete proof, and then punish the creation for not turning towards him. Indeed, the bounty of the Sovereign of existence has encompassed all possibilities through the appearance of the manifestations of His Self, and His grace never ceases, nor is the rain of His mercy ever withheld from the clouds of His bounty.

So these incidents are only brought about by limited selves that move in the valley of pride and vanity, travel in the deserts of remoteness, and hold onto their presumptions and what they have heard from their scholars. For this reason, they have nothing but aversion, and they will achieve nothing but ignorance. It is clear to anyone with insight that if these servants were to purify their eyes, ears, and hearts from what they have seen, heard, and perceived at the appearance of each of the manifestations of the Sun of Truth, they would undoubtedly not be deprived of the Divine beauty and would not be forbidden from the sanctuary of proximity and the study of the Divine.

However, since at every time they judged the proof based on their own understanding that they had heard from their scholars, and it did not accord with their weak intellects, thus such unpleasant incidents were made manifest from them in the world. They measured the Manifestations of God by the yardstick of their own understanding, limited by what they had learned from their scholars. When the Divine manifestations did not conform to their limited understanding, this led to various forms of dissatisfaction and rebellion against these Divine manifestations.

### Corruption of the Leaders of Religion {#sec-corruption-of-the-leaders-of-religion}

15 In every age, the reason for the deviation of the masses and their prevention from reaching the shores of the sea of divine unity has been the scholars of that age, who held the reins of the people in their hands. These leaders, some motivated by a love for leadership and others due to a lack of knowledge and understanding, hindered the people from recognizing the divine truth. It was due to the orders and verdicts of these scholars that all the Prophets had to drink from the chalice of martyrdom and ascended to the highest horizon of glory. Great injustices have been perpetrated by the leaders and scholars of every age against these sovereigns of existence and gems of divine purpose.

They remained content with these fleeting days and remained away from the realm that never perishes, depriving their eyes of witnessing the lights of the beloved's beauty, and making their ears deprived of the unique melodies of the desired Beloved. This is why the conditions of the scholars of every age have been mentioned in all divine scriptures. As it is said: "O People of the Book! Why do you deny the signs of God while you bear witness to them?" (Quran 3:70). Similarly, it is said: "O People of the Book! Why do you mix truth with falsehood, and conceal the truth while you know?" (Quran 3:71). In another place, it is said: "Say, O People of the Book! Why do you block the path of God?" (Quran 3:99).

It is clear that the "People of the Book" who have hindered people from the straight path are the scholars of that age, as the names and descriptions of them are mentioned in the scriptures, and this is evident from most of the verses and narrations if you look through the lens of divine justice.

16 So, try to contemplate with the divine insight upon the horizons of divine knowledge and the depth of perfect words of the Eternal, so that all the secrets of spiritual wisdom, free from the limitations of worldly grandeur, become apparent from behind the curtains of divine grace and benevolence. Most of the objections and disputes raised by people are due to their lack of understanding and comprehension.

For instance, they failed to comprehend and connect with the divine truths revealed in the signs and utterances of God's beauty. Consequently, they raised the flag of corruption and incited chaos and conflict. It is clear that the interpretations of eternal words can only be comprehended by eternal beings, and the melodious songs of spiritual realities can only be heard by the listeners who belong to the world of eternity. An oppressive Copt can never partake from the justice-filled wine of the Israelite lineage, and the Pharaoh of disbelief cannot grasp the wisdom encapsulated within the pure essence of Moses. As it is said: "None know its interpretation save Allah and those firmly grounded in knowledge." (Quran 3:7)

Despite this, they sought the interpretation of the Book from those veiled from the divine truth and did not seek knowledge from its true source.

17 For example, when the days of Moses passed and the lights of Jesus enveloped the spiritual world, all the Jews objected. They claimed that the promised figure mentioned in the Torah should be a promulgator and fulfiller of the laws of the Torah. But this young Nazarene, who called himself the Christ of God, had abrogated the laws of divorce and Sabbath, which were among the most important laws of Moses. Furthermore, they argued that the signs of the appearance mentioned in the Torah had not yet manifested, as they are still waiting for that appearance.

They missed the holy manifestations of the Divine Unity and the emanation of eternal light that appeared after Moses due to their satanic veils of self and imaginary doubts. They are still veiled and waiting for the appearance of a fabricated temple with the mentioned signs that they have perceived. As such, God punished them for their sins, took away the spirit of faith from them, and punished them with a fire that resides in the depths of hell.

This happened only due to their lack of understanding of the written statements in the Torah concerning the signs of the coming era. As they could not comprehend the truth of these statements, and since the literal events did not happen as they expected, they were deprived of the beauty of Jesus and failed to meet God. They were among the waiting ones. They clung to these baseless thoughts and made themselves deprived of the blessings flowing from the subtle, gentle springs of wisdom.

The same phenomenon persists among all nations, who hold on to such baseless ideas, and thereby deprive themselves of the blessings flowing from the subtle and gentle sources of wisdom.

18 In unveiling these mysteries, some of the statements of the Prophets were referred to in the melodies of Hijazi inscriptions on the previously written tablets for one of the beloved ones. Now, in response to the desire of that person, we mention them again in these pages with the sweet tunes of the Iraqi melody. Perhaps this may guide those who are thirsty in the deserts of the future towards the ocean of proximity, and may lead those lost in the wilderness of separation to the tents of closeness and unity, so that the clouds of misguidance may lift, and the sun of guiding light may rise from the horizon of the soul.

I rely on God and seek His assistance, hoping that this pen may write something to revive the hearts of people, so that everyone may rise from their slumber of heedlessness and may hear the divine tunes from the leaves of paradise, from a tree that was planted in the divine garden by the hands of divine power, with the permission of God.

### The Unity and Return of the Manifestations {#sec-the-unity-and-return-of-the-manifestations}

19 Indeed, it is known and clear to the possessors of knowledge that when the fire of the love of Jesus burned away the veils of Jewish boundaries and his command was generally executed outwardly, one day that hidden beauty mentioned to some of his spiritual companions the subject of parting and ignited the fire of longing, saying, "I am going, and I will come again," and in another place, he said, "I am going, and another will come to say what I have not said and to complete what I have said." These two statements are, in truth, one if you witness in the manifestations of unity through the eyes of God.

20 If seen with the eye of spiritual insight, in truth, during the era of the Seal (Muhammad), both the book of Jesus and his command were affirmed. In the place of the name, he himself said: "I am Jesus." He also confirmed the signs, news, and book of Jesus, stating that it was from God. In this respect, there is no discernible difference in themselves or any notable otherness in their books since both were established by the command of God and both spoke in the remembrance of God, and the books of both were conscious of God's commands. This is why Jesus himself said, "I am going, and I will return." It's like the sun, if today's sun says, "I am the sun of the previous day", it's truthful, and if it says, "I am different from the sun of other days," it's also truthful.

Similarly, if you observe in all matters that if it is said that all is one thing, it is correct and true. If it is said that they are different in terms of specific names and forms, that is also true. As you can see, even though they are one thing, each has a different name, different characteristics, and different forms that are not found in the other.

By this explanation and rule, understand the detailed positions, differences, and unity of the holy manifestations. So you can comprehend the implications of the words of that Creator of names and attributes in both collective and individual aspects, and you will become knowledgeable and aware. The answer to your question about recognizing that eternal beauty in each of its positions by its specific name and form will be fully attained.

21 After that, the disciples of Jesus asked about the signs of His return and appearance: "What are the signs, and when will this happen?" They asked this question of the unparalleled Jesus on several occasions, and in each situation, he mentioned different signs, as is recorded in the four Gospels.

### The Signs of the Return of Jesus Christ {#sec-the-signs-of-the-return-of-jesus-christ}

22 And I will mention one such sign and offer hidden blessings from the reserved Lote Tree for the sake of God to the servants of God so that the transient temples may not be deprived of the everlasting fruits. Perhaps they may be successful with a drop from the ever-flowing rivers of the glorious presence, which is flowing in the Abode of Peace, Baghdad, without asking for any reward or gratitude. "We feed you only for the sake of Allah. We wish not from you reward or gratitude." This is a nourishment by which luminous spirits and hearts attain everlasting life. This is indeed the same table of which it is said: "Our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven." And this table will never be severed from its people, nor will it ever be depleted. It always sprouts from the Tree of Grace and descends from the heavens of mercy and justice. As it has been said: "Have you not considered how Allah sets forth a parable of a good word being like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches are high in the sky. It produces its fruit all the time."

23 What a loss it would be for a person to deprive oneself of this delicate gift, to exclude oneself from this everlasting bounty and eternal life. So understand the value of this spiritual table so that perhaps the dead bodies may find new life from the unique graces of that true Sun, and the withered souls may attain limitless spirituality. My brother, we must strive while days remain to drink from the cups of eternity. The breeze of life does not always blow from the Egypt of the Beloved, nor do the rivers of elucidation always flow. The doors of paradise do not remain open forever. There will come a time when the nightingales of paradise will fly from the holy garden to the divine nests, then neither the melody of the nightingale will you hear, nor the beauty of the flower will you see. So while the eternal dove is in song and dance, and the divine spring is in display and adornment, do not leave the ear of your heart bereft of its melody. This is the advice of this servant to that gentleman and the friends of God. So whoever wishes, let him accept, and whoever wishes, let him turn away. Verily, Allah is self-sufficient, transcendent over what is witnessed and seen.

24 These are the melodies of Jesus son of Mary, who in the paradise of the Gospel spoke with the majestic tunes about the signs of the next appearance. In the first book attributed to Matthew, when asked about the signs of the next appearance, he replied, "And for the time after, there will be great distress in those days, the sun will darken, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will shake. At that time, the signs of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with great power and glory, and he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call." End of quote. The Persian translation is as follows: After the hardship and adversity that encompass all people, the sun is prevented from effusion, that is, it becomes dark, and the moon remains from giving light, and the stars of the sky descend to the earth, and the pillars of the earth shake. At this time, the signs of the Son of Man appear in the sky, that is, the beauty of the promised one and the essence of existence comes from the realm of the unseen to the world of witnessing after the appearance of these signs. He says, "At that time, all the tribes that live on earth will mourn and cry, and they will see the creatures of that unified beauty coming from the sky in a state that is riding on the cloud with great strength and generosity, and he sends his angels with the sound of a great trumpet." End of quote. The same expressions are mentioned in the other three books attributed to Luke, Mark, and John. As it was detailed in the Arabic tablets, we did not repeat it in these papers and we were satisfied with mentioning one of them.

25 The scholars of the Gospel, as they did not become acquainted with the meanings of these statements and the purpose hidden in these words, and adhered to the apparent meaning of them, were therefore barred from the beneficence of the Muhammadan law and from the cloud of Ahmad's grace. And the ignorant of that sect also sought adherence to their scholars, and were deprived of visiting the beauty of the Sultan of Glory, because such signs as were mentioned did not appear at the emergence of the Ahmadian sun. This is why centuries have passed, epochs have come to an end, and that spiritual essence has returned to the eternal seat of its sovereignty, another breath from the spiritual breath has been breathed into the divine forms, and the dead souls from the graves of negligence and misguidance have been resurrected to the land of guidance and the place of attention. Yet, that group is still waiting for when these signs will appear, and that promised edifice will come into existence, so that they can assist it, spend their wealth in its way, and sacrifice their lives for it. Just as other nations have also remained distant from the Kawthar of meanings of the infinite mercy of the Lord due to their illusions, and are occupied with their own imaginations.

26 Moving past this statement, there is another declaration in the Gospel which states: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away". The meaning of this in Persian is that it is possible for heaven and earth to perish, but my words will never perish and will always remain constant among people. This is why the people of the Gospel say that the laws of the Gospel will never be abrogated and whenever the promised manifestation appears with all its signs, it must confirm and establish the exalted laws in the Gospel so that no other religion remains in the entire world except this one. This sentence is among the established and confirmed matters for them. They have come to believe that even if a person is sent with all the signs of the promised one and passes judgments contrary to the apparent laws in the Gospel, they will certainly not admit or accept it, but rather they will declare him a disbeliever and mock him. This was evident during the emergence of the Muhammadan sun. Now, if people had asked the manifestations of the Divine Unity in every appearance about the meanings of these words revealed in the books, which all people are veiled from due to their inability to reach the ultimate heights and the farthest Lote Tree, they would certainly have been guided by the lights of the sun of guidance and would have become acquainted with the secrets of knowledge and wisdom.

27 Now, I will mention some of the meanings of these words so that those with insight and natural disposition may understand their implications within all divine words and indications in holy expressions. This way, they will not be deprived of the bounty of divine names and attributes, and they will not be veiled from the lamp of Divine Unity, which is the place of the manifestation of the Divine Essence.

### Interpretation of the Signs {#sec-interpretation-of-the-signs}

#### Distress of Those Days {#sec-distress-of-those-days}

28 The phrase "after the distress of those days" means a time when people are afflicted with hardship and constriction. This happens when the traces of the Sun of Truth and the fruits of the Lote-Tree of Knowledge and Wisdom disappear among people, when the reins of society are taken over by the ignorant, when the gates of Divine Unity and knowledge - which is the main purpose of human creation - are closed, when knowledge turns into conjecture, and guidance succumbs to misguidance. This is observed today as the reins of every group have fallen into the hands of the ignorant who guide their people according to their desires. Among these people, nothing of God remains except a name, and nothing of the ultimate purpose remains except words.

The winds of desires and self-interests have blown so strongly that they have extinguished the lamps of reason and the heart in many souls. Even though the gates of divine knowledge have been opened by the keys of divine power and the potential existences have been illuminated and guided by the light of knowledge and the holy effusions. So much so, that in everything a gate of knowledge has been opened, and in every atom traces of the Sun have become apparent.

Despite all these manifestations of knowledge that have encompassed the world, they still consider the gate of knowledge closed and the showers of mercy to be severed. Clinging to conjecture, they have distanced themselves from the firm handhold of knowledge. It seems as if they have no natural inclination towards knowledge and do not even fantasize about its appearance because they have found doors in conjecture to earn their livelihood and in the appearance of the manifestation of knowledge, they have found nothing but sacrificing their lives.

They are fleeing from this and clinging to that. And although they consider the divine command to be one, they observe two breaths on one command. They do not seek anything other than divine desire and they do not want a path other than error. They consider leadership as the ultimate attainment of the desired and pride and arrogance as the peak of maturation towards the beloved. They prefer self-deception over divine determinations. They have bypassed submission and contentment and are busy with scheming and pretense. They try with all their might and power to preserve these positions so that no deficiency finds its way into their grandeur or any defect touches their glory.

And if an eye is brightened with the kohl of divine knowledge, it will observe a few predators that have fallen upon the carcasses of the souls of servants.

29 Now, what distress and constriction could be more severe than the aforementioned conditions? If one wants to seek truth or knowledge, they wouldn't know where to go or whom to seek. This is due to the diversity of opinions and the multitude of paths.

This distress and constriction is a condition of every Manifestation that until it does not occur, the emergence of the Sun of Truth does not occur. Because the dawn of the guidance of the Manifestation comes after the night of misguidance. This is what is meant by the narrations and traditions that speak of disbelief engulfing the world, darkness prevailing, and similar themes as mentioned earlier.

As for me, I have not elaborated on the statements of the traditions due to their widespread fame and for the sake of brevity.

30 Now, if the meaning of this distress is perceived to be physical worldly distress or other considerations imagined in their own mind, it will never be observed, and they would indeed argue that this condition for the emergence \[of the Manifestation\] has not been met, as they have said and continue to say. But indeed, the meaning of 'distress' is the constriction in regards to divine knowledge and the understanding of divine words. This is the distress that afflicts people during the time of the setting of the Sun \[of divine guidance\] and its mirrors, not knowing to whom they should turn, as mentioned earlier.

Thus, we teach you the interpretation of the traditions and cast upon you some of the secrets of wisdom, so that you may apprehend what is intended and be among those who have drunk from the cup of knowledge and gnosis.

#### Sun, Moon, and Stars {#sec-sun-moon-and-stars}

31 And his saying: "The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky." The sun and the moon referred to in the words of the prophets are not limited to this visible sun and moon that we observe. Rather, they have indicated many meanings for the sun and the moon, and in each context, they refer to an appropriate meaning.

For example, one meaning of the sun is the Suns of Truth, which rise from the horizon of the Divine Presence and bestow grace upon all possibilities. These Suns of Truth are the universal manifestations of the divine in the worlds of His attributes and names. Just as the visible sun nourishes visible objects, such as fruits, trees, colors, fruits, minerals, and the like that are observable in the physical world, by the command of the True Deity and with His assistance, similarly the trees of monotheism, the fruits of singularity, the leaves of abstraction, the flowers of knowledge and certitude, and the fragrant herbs of wisdom and eloquence become manifest through the care and grace of these spiritual suns.

This is why, during the illumination of these Suns, the world becomes renewed; the rivers of life flow; the oceans of benevolence are set in motion; the clouds of grace are raised; the breezes of generosity blow upon the bodies of creatures; and it is from the heat of these divine Suns and the spiritual fires that the heat of divine love is generated in the pillars of the world, and it is through the grace of these detached spirits that the everlasting animal soul is bestowed upon the transient dead bodies.

In truth, this visible sun is a sign of the manifestation of that spiritual Sun, which has no counterpart, resemblance, similarity, or equal and cannot be observed. Everything exists due to it, appears by its grace, and returns to it. From it, all things have appeared and returned to the treasuries of its command. From it, all possibilities have begun and returned to the treasures of its decree.

32 And the fact that in the context of expression and mention, some of the names and attributes are specified as you have heard and will hear, is only for the understanding of imperfect and weak intellects. Otherwise, He has always been and will always remain sanctified from any name, and will remain exalted from any attribute. The essence of the names has no path to His sacred domain, and the subtleties of the attributes have no way in the dominion of His honor.

So glory be to God, that His chosen ones cannot be recognized except by their own selves, and His friends cannot be described except by their own selves. He is exalted beyond what His servants mention in their descriptions, and He is exalted beyond what they understand. The divine essence is utterly beyond comprehension and is independent of any attribute or name ascribed by His creations. He is absolutely transcendent and indescribable.

33 The usage of the term 'suns' for those abstract lights has been frequent in the discourses of the infallible ones. For instance, in Du'a Nudba (a Shia prayer), it is said: "Where are the rising suns? Where are the illuminating moons? Where are the shining stars?" So, it is understood that the primary implication of 'suns', 'moons', and 'stars' is referring to the prophets, the saints, and their companions whose divine knowledge enlightens both the unseen and the seen worlds. These are the spiritual luminaries that guide humanity with their divine knowledge and wisdom.

34 In another context, the 'suns', 'moons', and 'stars' refer to the leading scholars who are present during the advent of a new divine emergence. They hold the reins of the religion of the people. If they become illuminated by the light of that new spiritual 'sun', they are accepted, enlightened, and clear. Otherwise, the rule of darkness applies to them, even though they may appear to be guides. This is because all these states - faith or disbelief, guidance or misguidance, happiness or misery, light or darkness - are conditional upon acknowledging that divine spiritual 'sun'.

The judgment of faith for each scholar is determined at the onset of recognition on the Day of Mutual Disillusion (Yawm at-Taghabun) and the judgment of knowledge, approval, light, and faith regarding the new spiritual 'sun' is truthful for them. Otherwise, the judgment of ignorance, denial, disbelief, and darkness is applicable to them.

35 Indeed, it's observable to any discerning observer that just as the light of a star fades with the rise of the physical sun, likewise the 'sun' of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding fades and becomes obscured with the rise of the true spiritual 'sun'. When the spiritual 'sun' or divine manifestation arises, it outshines all else, making other sources of knowledge and wisdom appear dim in comparison. It's a metaphysical representation that the ultimate knowledge and wisdom is the direct divine revelation, and all other sources of knowledge pale in comparison to it.

36 Indeed, the term 'sun' is used metaphorically for those scholars due to their elevated status, renown, and recognition, such as the well-known scholars of the Muslim era who are renowned across lands and recognized amongst people. If they bear witness to the divine 'sun', they are considered among the lofty 'suns'. However, if they do not, they are considered among the 'suns' of the infernal world, as is said, "The sun and the moon \[move\] by precise calculation" (Qur'an 55:5).

The meaning of the 'sun' and 'moon' in the aforementioned verse is well known, so there's no need to elaborate on it here. Every soul who is part of the 'element' of this sun and moon, that is, inclined towards falsehood and turning away from truth, will indeed be subject to the visible calculation and will return to the calculation (divine judgement).

37 So, oh seeker, we must hold tightly to the "firmest handhold" (Qur'an 2:256) so that we might be led from the darkness of misguidance to the light of guidance, that we might flee the shadow of negation to find refuge in the shadow of affirmation, and that we might escape from the fire of calculation (divine judgement) to become illuminated in the light of the beauty of the Most Generous. Peace be upon you.

Just as such, we provide you with the fruits of the tree of knowledge, so that you may remain in the satisfaction of God's wisdom, as one of the scholars.

38 In another context, the sun, moon, and stars metaphorically refer to the elevated sciences and rulings in each religious law, such as prayer and fasting, which are the most firm and greatest of all rulings in the Qur'an's law, following the veiling of the Muhammadan beauty. This is as indicated in various hadiths and reports, and due to their well-known nature, there is no need for further mention. Indeed, in every era, the ruling of prayer has been firmly established and enforced.

39 As it has been reported from the radiant light of the Muhammadan sun that the ruling of prayer has been revealed to all prophets in every era, ultimately, in each era, it is assigned specific new sections and etiquette as required by the time. Because in every subsequent revelation, the clear, established lofty sciences, customs, and solid rulings of the previous revelation are abrogated, they have thus been metaphorically referred to as the sun and the moon. This is in accordance with the verse, "That He may test which of you is best in deed." (Qur'an 67:2)

40 Indeed, in a hadith, fasting and prayer have been referred to as the sun and the moon respectively. It has been said, "Fasting is a radiance and prayer is a light." However, I remember an incident when I was sitting in a place and a renowned scholar came in. On one occasion, he mentioned this hadith and said: As fasting creates heat in one's temperament, it is likened to radiance, which is represented by the sun. And the night prayer, as it requires coolness, is thus represented by light, symbolized by the moon.

I observed that the scholar hadn't grasped even a droplet from the ocean of meanings and hadn't attained a spark from the Lote Tree of Divine wisdom. After a while, with utmost respect, I pointed out that what he had mentioned regarding the meaning of the hadith is commonly cited in languages and mouths of people. However, it seemed that another purpose could also be inferred from the hadith. He asked for this explanation. I mentioned that the Seal of the Prophets and the Master of the Pure Ones have metaphorically referred to the exalted religion in the Qur'an as the sky due to its highness, elevation, greatness, and encompassing all religions.

Just as in the visible sky, two greatest and firmest pillars have been established, named the sun and the moon, which are luminous, similarly, in the sky of religion, two luminous elements have been determined, which are fasting and prayer. "Islam is the sky, fasting is its sun, and prayer is its moon."

41 Indeed, this is the intent behind the symbolic expressions of divine manifestations. Thus, the usage of sun and moon in these contexts for these mentioned positions has been affirmed and established through revealed verses and transmitted traditions.

The purpose of mentioning the darkening of the sun and moon and the falling of the stars is to illustrate the misguidance of scholars and the abrogation of the high rulings in the Shariah, a notion which is metaphorically communicated through these traditions.

However, not everyone can partake from this cup of understanding; only the virtuous have a share, and only the best receive a portion. As the Qur'an states: "Indeed the virtuous will drink from a cup mixed with kafur." (76:5). This verse metaphorically expresses the purity and reward of the righteous and their reception of divine knowledge and enlightenment.

42 It is firmly established that in each subsequent divine manifestation, the sun of knowledge, rulings, commands, and prohibitions that were exalted in the previous manifestation, under whose light and shade the people of that era were enlightened and guided, becomes dark. This means that its ruling and effect come to an end.

Consider, then, if the followers of the Gospel had understood the intended meaning of the sun and the moon, or had sought clarification from the manifestation of divine knowledge without obstinacy or quarreling, they would undoubtedly have understood its meanings, and they would not have fallen prey to the darkness of self and desire. However, because they did not draw knowledge from its source and origin, they fell into the destructive valley of disbelief and misguidance and have met their ruin. They have yet to realize that the universal signs have appeared, and the promised sun has dawned on the horizon of manifestation, while the sun and moon of knowledge, rulings, and recognitions from the previous era have become dark and set.

43 Now, step onto the path of true certainty with the eye of knowledge of certainty and the wings of the essence of certainty. "Say, 'God,' then leave them in their discourse, playing." So that you may be counted among those who say, "Indeed, those who have said, 'Our Lord is Allah,' and then remained on a right course, the angels will descend upon them." And so that you may witness all of these mysteries with your own eyes.

44 O my brother, take the steps of the soul so that you may swiftly traverse the vast desert of distance and separation, and enter into the divine pleasure of nearness and union. In a single breath, you may attain to divine realities. With physical steps alone, these stages will never be traversed, and the intended goal will never be reached. Peace be upon those who follow the truth with truth, and who stand on the path of the divine command at the shore of gnosis, paused in the name of God.

45 This is the meaning of the blessed verse where it says: "So I swear by the Lord of all the easts and the wests." (Quran 70:40). This is because each of these mentioned suns has a place of rising and setting. But because the scholars of interpretation did not have information about the reality of these mentioned suns, they were stuck in the interpretation of this blessed verse.

Some have mentioned that since the sun rises each day from a different point than the day before, the verse refers to this plurality. And some others have written that the four seasons are meant, as the sun rises and sets from a different place in each season, hence the use of the plural "easts and wests". These are the degrees of knowledge of the servants. But despite this, what ignorance and defects they attribute to the essence of knowledge and the subtleties of wisdom!

#### Splitting of the Sky {#sec-splitting-of-the-sky}

46 And likewise, comprehend the splitting of the sky, which is among the signs of the Hour and the Resurrection, from these clear, firm, precise, and non-analogous statements. This is what it says: "When the sky has split open" (Quran 82:1). The intended sky is the sky of religions, which is raised in each appearance and then split in the next appearance, that is, it becomes invalidated and abrogated.

I swear to God that if one looks properly, the splitting of this sky is greater than the splitting of the physical sky. Consider for a moment. A religion that has been raised for years, and everyone has thrived and flourished under its shade, and have been nurtured for years by its bright commands, and from their fathers and ancestors have heard nothing but the mention of it, to the extent that eyes have perceived nothing but the infiltration of its command, and ears have heard nothing but its rules, then suddenly, someone appears and disperses all these things by divine strength and power, and separates them, in fact, negates all of them.

Now think, is this not greater than the splitting of the physical sky?

47 Reflect on the hardship and bitterness of those divine manifestations, who establish God's boundaries in the face of all people of the world without any apparent supporter or helper. Consider the harm inflicted on those blessed, delicate beings, and yet how they bear all with utmost patience and endurance.

This highlights the struggles and trials that divine manifestations (such as prophets and other spiritual leaders) endure in the course of their missions. These figures, despite facing numerous hardships, continue to establish and uphold God's commandments, reflecting their commitment, fortitude, and unwavering faith. Their patience and resilience in the face of adversity serve as powerful lessons for their followers, emphasizing the spiritual strength that can be found in faith and devotion.

#### Transformation of the Earth {#sec-transformation-of-the-earth}

48 Also, grasp the meaning of the transformation of the earth. The clouds of mercy from that sky transformed the lands of those hearts that had been receptive to the grace, into the land of knowledge and wisdom. How the fragrances of monotheism have sprouted in the gardens of their hearts, and how the anemones of the realities of knowledge and wisdom have been seen to bloom from their radiant breasts.

If the earth of their hearts was not transformed, how could men who had never received any formal education, who had never seen a teacher, and who had never stepped foot in any school, articulate words and possess knowledge that no one else could comprehend? As if they were molded from the clay of eternal knowledge and kneaded with the water of Divine wisdom.

This is what is meant when it is said: "Knowledge is a light that God casts into the heart of whomever He wishes." And it is this kind of knowledge that is praiseworthy and enduring. Not the limited sciences that are created from clouded and veiled thoughts, which are sometimes plagiarized and then boasted about to others.

49 "If only the hearts of the servants would become clear from the imprints of these restrictions and obscure words, perhaps they would win through the manifestation of the lights of the Sun of Knowledge, meanings, and the jewels of the mysteries of divine wisdom. Observe now, if these earthly existences were not transformed, how could they become the place of the emergence of the secrets of oneness and the blossoming of the jewels of singularity? This is what He says:"On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth."

50 "And from the breezes of generosity of that Sovereign of existence, the physical earth too has been transformed, if only you would contemplate in the mysteries of these manifestations."

51 "Further understand the meaning of this verse where it says: 'And the earth entirely will be \[within\] His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.' The content of this verse indicates that all of the earth will be grasped, in His hand on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens will be folded, in His right hand. Now, some fairness is required: if the intent is what people have understood, how well would it fit? It is self-evident that it is impossible to attribute to the Essence of the Almighty a visible hand that performs these operations - such a belief is sheer disbelief and an outright falsehood. If you say that they are the manifestations of His command that will be ordered to do this on the Day of Resurrection, this too is extremely far-fetched and pointless. Rather, the meaning of 'earth' is the earth of knowledge and understanding, and by 'heavens', the heavens of religions are meant. Now consider how the earth of knowledge and understanding, which was previously spread out, was gathered up by the might and power, and a new exalted earth was spread out in the hearts of the servants. He caused new breezes and unique flowers and majestic trees to sprout from their enlightened hearts."

52 And likewise, observe how the lofty heavens of the past religions were folded by the hand of power, and the heaven of divine Revelation was elevated, adorned with new, wondrous commands as its sun, moon, and stars. These are the mysteries of words, unveiled without a veil, so that you may perceive the dawn of meanings, extinguish the lamps of suspicions, doubts, and uncertainties with the power of trust and detachment, and ignite the new lamp of knowledge and certitude in the lanterns of the heart and soul.

### God Tests the Servants {#sec-god-tests-the-servants}

53 The purpose of all these enigmatic utterances and puzzling allusions emerging from the divine sources is to test the servants, as has been mentioned, in order to distinguish the fertile, radiant hearts from the barren, transient ones. This has always been the divine practice among the servants, as recorded in the sacred books.

#### The Direction of Prayer {#sec-the-direction-of-prayer}

54 Also, consider the verse about the direction of prayer (Qiblah). After the Sun of the Muhammadan Prophethood migrated from the East of Mecca to Yathrib, they would direct their face towards the Holy Temple in Jerusalem during the time of prayer. This continued until certain Jews made unsuitable comments, which are not worth mentioning here and would prolong the discussion. This distressed the Prophet greatly and He often looked towards the sky in contemplation and bewilderment. Then Gabriel descended and recited this verse: "We have indeed seen the turning of your face towards the sky, so We will surely turn you to a Qiblah which you will be pleased with."

One day, the Prophet and a group of His companions were engaged in the noon prayer. They had performed two units of the prayer when Gabriel descended and said, "Turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque." In the middle of the prayer, the Prophet turned from the Holy Temple in Jerusalem and faced the Kaaba in Mecca. This immediately caused a commotion and disturbance among the companions, to the point that some of them disrupted their prayer and turned away.

This trial was not for anything except to test the servants. Otherwise, that True Sovereign had the power to not change any direction of prayer at all and could have chosen the Holy Temple in that age as well, and not have this honor taken away from it.

55 As was the case during the time of most of the Prophets who were sent after Moses, like David, Jesus, and those who came in between them, the command of the direction of prayer was not changed. All these messengers, by the order of the Lord of the worlds, directed the people towards that same direction. The relation of all lands is the same to that True Sovereign, except for any land that He specifically designates for the manifestation of His signs. As it is said: "To Allah belong the East and the West, so wherever you turn, there is the face of Allah."

Despite the truth of these matters, why was the change made that caused distress and fear among the servants and caused a commotion and disturbance among the companions? Indeed, such occurrences that cause terror in all souls do not happen except for everyone to be put to the test by God, so that the truthful and the liar can be distinguished and separated from each other.

This is why, after the disagreement among people, it is said: "We did not make the direction of prayer that you were on except to know who follows the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels." The meaning of this is: we did not turn and disrupt the direction of prayer, which was the Holy Temple, except to know who follows you and who turns back on his heels, meaning who turns away, does not obey, and invalidates his prayer and runs away, like "terrified donkeys fleeing from a lion."

56 If you ponder a bit on this subject and statement, you will see the doors of meanings and clarifications opening up, and you can see all its knowledge and secrets unveiled. These matters are only for the purpose of educating and liberating souls from the cage of self and desires. Otherwise, that True Sovereign has always been in His essence independent of the recognition of beings and will always remain in His existence independent of the worship of the possible ones.

A single breeze from His richness can adorn the entire world with the robe of wealth, and a single drop from the ocean of His generosity can endow all existence with eternal life. But, as the aim is to distinguish truth from falsehood and sunlight from shadow, this is why the trials dispatched from the Lord of Honor flow incessantly like pouring rain.

#### Moses Killed a Man {#sec-moses-killed-a-man}

57 If you contemplate a bit on the previous prophets and their appearances, things will become very clear to the people of the world in such a way that they will not remain veiled from deeds and sayings that are contrary to the self and desires. They will burn all veils with the fire of the Lote-tree of Gnosis and rest on the Throne of tranquility and reassurance.

For instance, Moses, the son of Amran, who was one of the great prophets and the bearer of the book. In the early stages of his life, before his prophecy, he was passing by a market one day. Two men were quarreling with each other. One of them sought help from Moses. Moses helped him and killed the adversary, as it is recorded in the book, and mentioning the details would distract from the main purpose.

News of this spread in the city and Moses became fearful as the scripture says. He was informed that "Indeed, the nobles are plotting against you to kill you." So he left the city and resided in Midian in the service of Shuaib. On his return, he entered the blessed valley that is the Valley of Sinai. He observed the manifestation of the Sovereign Unity from a tree that was neither of the east nor the west. He heard a soul-nourishing spiritual call from the divine ignited fire, and was commanded to guide Pharaoh's souls to rescue people from the valley of ego and desire and to introduce them to the soul-enriching wilderness of guidance.

When he entered Pharaoh's house and preached as he was ordered to, Pharaoh rudely said, "Were you not the one who committed murder and became one of the disbelievers?" As if the Lord of Majesty informed Moses through Pharaoh's tongue: "And you did your deed which you did, and you were one of the disbelievers. So I did it then, and I was of the misguided, so I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers."

58 Now, consider the divine trials and the unique ways God tests us. A soul that is known for killing another soul and confesses to its injustice as stated in the mentioned verse, one who was raised for approximately thirty years or a little less, apparently in the house of Pharaoh, nurtured with his food, is chosen from among the servants and is assigned to guide.

While the capable Sovereign had the power to prevent Moses from committing murder so that he would not be known among the servants by this name, which would cause terror in hearts and caution in souls. But this wasn't the case. It's a clear indication of the unique and sometimes baffling ways God chooses to test his creations, demonstrating that even those who commit serious mistakes can be given a chance to reform and serve a higher purpose. The spiritual path is filled with such trials and tests, all designed to help individuals grow and evolve. The divine trials and the extraordinary ways God tests individuals are beyond human comprehension. God's wisdom and plans are mysterious and cannot be fully understood by humans.

#### The Situation of Mary {#sec-the-situation-of-mary}

59 Also consider the situation of Mary, whose extraordinary situation caused such amazement and bewilderment that she wished for non-existence, as understood from the blessed verse where, after the birth of Jesus, Mary lamented and spoke these words: "Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten." (Quran 19:23)

By God, hearts melt and spirits weep upon hearing these words. This anxiety and grief was due to the scorn of enemies and the objection of disbelievers. Think for a moment, what could Mary have said in response to people? How could a child with no designated father be presented to people as a product of the Holy Spirit?

In this predicament, Mary carried the child back to her people. When they saw her with the baby, they exclaimed, "O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste." (Quran 19:28). Look at this great trial and profound test.

In both Moses and Mary's stories, we see God's wisdom in testing and guiding his servants through immense trials, yet also providing them the strength and means to endure and ultimately fulfill their divine roles. These are instances of the grand tests that God places before his servants, highlighting the struggles they faced and the triumphs they achieved in their quest for spiritual fulfillment and service to God.

60 Indeed, surpassing all, that essence of spirit, known among his people for his fatherless birth, was granted prophethood by God. He was made a proof of God's truth for all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. Jesus, despite the circumstances of his miraculous birth, was chosen by God to be a prophet and a sign for humanity. He exemplifies the divine wisdom and power, standing as a testament to God's ability to bring about the extraordinary. His life and teachings continue to inspire millions around the world, highlighting the potential for transcendence and holiness in all of us, regardless of our circumstances.

61 Indeed, the ways of God may seem contrary to the wishes and desires of His servants. However, once you perceive the jewels of secrets behind these, you come to understand His true intent. You begin to see the actions and words of that sovereign Creator in alignment, such that what you observe in His actions is reflected in His words, and what you perceive in His words manifests in His actions. These deeds and sayings may appear as punishment for the wicked in their outward form, but within, they are a mercy for the righteous. If observed with the eye of the heart, the words revealed from the heavens of Divine Will are seen to be one with the manifested affairs from the dominion of Divine Power. They are perceived as one entity, as was discussed.

In other words, to truly comprehend the Divine Will, one must look beyond the surface, beyond what is simply perceived by the physical senses. It is necessary to observe with the eye of the heart, the spiritual insight, to understand the unity of God's words and actions, and to recognize the deep mercy inherent in all divine affairs. Through this profound comprehension, one realizes the Divine's transcendent wisdom and infinite mercy, even in what may outwardly appear as trials or tribulations.

#### How Would People React in this Era? {#sec-how-would-people-react-in-this-era}

62 Indeed, my brother, consider this: if such circumstances were to appear in this era, if such stories were to emerge, how would people react? I swear by the Creator of existence and the One who sends down the words that, immediately, without any discussion, they would likely pronounce disbelief and demand punishment. Would they listen if it was said that Jesus emerged from the breath of the Holy Spirit, or that Moses was commanded by a firm order? Even if a hundred thousand cries were raised, it would reach no one's ears that one without a father has been appointed to prophethood, or that a murderer from a burning tree has declared, "Indeed, I am God."

In our current age, such assertions would likely be met with disbelief and skepticism, just as they were in the past. This reflects the challenge of understanding and accepting divine intervention and prophecy, particularly when it comes in unexpected forms or contradicts prevailing norms and expectations. People often struggle to accept what they cannot understand within their limited human framework. However, faith requires openness to the mysterious and the divine, which often exceeds our limited human understanding.

63 If the eye of justice were to open, it would become evident from all these statements that the Manifestation of all these affairs and the outcome of all these days is now apparent. Even though the likes of these events have not occurred in this appearance, they have still been rejected due to their adherence to their own conjectures. What accusations they have made and what calamities they have caused, which have not even appeared in the formulation of their doubt.

### Fresh Tidings For the Soul {#sec-fresh-tidings-for-the-soul}

64 Allahu Akbar. The explanation that has reached this station has wafted a spiritual fragrance from the Eternal Dawn, and the morning breeze from the city of the everlasting Sheba has blown. Its hints have bestowed fresh tidings to the soul and immeasurable victories to the spirit. It has spread a new carpet and brought countless, boundless gifts from that sign-less Beloved. The cloak of remembrance falls short of His graceful stature, and the garment of expression is too brief for His radiant form. He reveals the mysteries of meanings without words and pronounces secrets without a tongue. He teaches the nightingales of longing and separation to lament and moan. He imparts the rules and customs of love and infatuation, and the mystery of devotion. He instructs the exotic flowers of the celestial garden of closeness and union in the art of coquetry and the manners of allure. He confers the secrets of truths to the poppies of the garden of love and entrusts the delicate mysteries and fine writings to the leaders of the lovers. By His grace, at this moment, He has caused the Holy Spirit to yearn intensely. He has given a droplet the waves of an ocean and endowed a particle with the ornament of the sun. He has taken kindness to a level that makes the pursuit of the musk-deer's navel seem insignificant, and has chosen the bat to face the sun. He has resurrected the dead with the breath of life from their bodily graves, placed the ignorant at the summit of knowledge, and set the oppressors at the height of justice.

65 And the world of existence has become pregnant with all these blessings until the effects of this unseen grace become manifest in the earthly realm, and brings the fallen thirsty ones to the crystalline Kawthar of the beloved, and leads the lost ones in the desert of distance and non-existence to the pavilion of nearness and existence of the beloved. So that in the land of hearts, these sacred grains may sprout and from the gardens of souls, the poppies of unseen realities may bloom. Indeed, the love's lote-tree in Sinai of affection has ignited in such a way that it can't be cooled or extinguished by the waters of expression. The thirst of this whale is not quenched by oceans, and this flaming phoenix chooses to nest nowhere but in the fire of the beloved's face. Therefore, my brother, kindle the lamp of the spirit in the difficulties of the heart with the wick of wisdom, and preserve it with the glass of intellect, so that the breaths of polytheistic souls do not extinguish it and do not withhold from the light. Thus, we illuminate the horizon of the sky of discourse with the lights of the suns of wisdom and knowledge, so that your heart may be at ease with it, and you may be among those who soared with the wings of certainty in the air of their merciful Lord's love.

#### The Sign of the Son of Man Appears {#sec-the-sign-of-the-son-of-man-appears}

66 And His saying: "Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven." He says: After the eclipse of the sun of divine knowledge and the falling of the stars of established laws, and the darkening of the moon of knowledge which is the educator of servants, and the extinction of the flags of guidance and prosperity, and the darkness of the dawn of truth and righteousness, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And what is meant by sky is the physical sky. Soon the equatorial heavens will manifest and the orbit of guidance will run over the sea of greatness, a star will appear in the sky, according to the outward appearance, which heralds the creation of the heavens of the advent of that greatest luminary. Similarly, in the sky of meaning, a star will appear that heralds the people of the earth to that dawn of the most upright and generous. And these two signs in the outward and inward sky have appeared before the advent of every prophet, as you have heard.

67 Among them was Abraham, the friend of the Most Merciful. Prior to his appearance, Nimrod saw a dream and asked the astrologers. They informed him of the rise of a star in the sky. Similarly, a person appeared on the earth who was giving glad tidings to the people of the upcoming appearance of that great figure.

68 After him, the story of Moses, the Speaker with Allah, took place. The astrologers of that time informed Pharaoh about the rising of a star in the sky, indicating the formation of a child who would be the cause of his and his people's destruction. Similarly, a scholar appeared who would comfort and reassure the children of Israel at night, as is recorded in the books. If the details of these matters were to be mentioned, this letter would become a book. I don't wish to recount past events. Allah is the witness of the state that this exposition is only due to the utmost love for that noble one, so that perhaps some of the poor of the earth may enter the shores of wealth, or a group of the ignorant may enter the sea of knowledge, or the thirsty for knowledge may reach the stream of wisdom. Otherwise, I would consider my engagement in these discussions to be a great sin and a major rebellion.

69 Similarly, as the appearance of Jesus neared, several Magi who were informed about the appearance of the star of Jesus in the sky followed the star until they entered the city where Herod had his royal residence. In those days, the dominion of those kingdoms was under his control.

70 And they were saying: "Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him." After investigation, they revealed that the child was born in Bethlehem of Judea. This is the sign in the literal sky.

As for the sign in the inner sky, which is the sky of knowledge and meanings, it was the appearance of John the son of Zechariah who was giving people the glad tidings of the arrival of Jesus. As the verse says: "Indeed, Allah gives you good tidings of John, confirming a word from Allah and \[who will be\] honorable, abstaining." The word referred to here is Jesus, and John was the harbinger of his advent.

It is also recorded in the divine scriptures: "John the Baptist was preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.'" And the John referred to here is John the Baptist.

71 Also, before the emergence of the Muhammadan beauty, signs appeared in the literal sky. The inner signs that were giving people on earth the glad tidings of the emergence of that sun of essence were four individuals, one after the other. Rozbeh, who came to be known as Salman, had the honor of serving them. When the time of death approached for each one, they would send Rozbeh to another until he reached the fourth one.

On his deathbed, he said: "O Rozbeh, after my burial, go to Hijaz (the region in western Saudi Arabia where Mecca and Medina are located), for the Muhammadan sun is about to shine, and may the wind bring you good tidings of meeting him."

72 Until he arrived at this wondrous and magnificent event. Most of the astronomers had reported the appearance of a star in the literal sky. Similarly, on earth, there were two luminous lights, Ahmad and Kazim, may God sanctify their resting place.

73 So, from these meanings, it's evident that before the appearance of each one of the mirrors of Divine Unity, signs of that appearance become apparent in both the literal and the metaphysical sky, which are the domains of the sun of knowledge and the moon of wisdom, and the stars of meanings and expressions. And that appearance is of the perfect human, prior to any manifestation, for the education and preparation of the servants for the encounter with that sun of essence and the moon of unity.

#### The Son of Man Comes on the Clouds of Heaven {#sec-the-son-of-man-comes-on-the-clouds-of-heaven}

74 And His saying: "And all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." The implication of this statement is this: meaning at that time, the servants will mourn due to the absence of the sun of divine beauty, the moon of knowledge, and the stars of divinely inspired wisdom. And in those moments, it will be witnessed that the promised radiance and the adored beauty descends from the sky while riding on the clouds, meaning that divine beauty will manifest in a human form from the heavens of divine will.

The meaning of "sky" here does not refer to the physical sky but signifies height and elevation, which is the place of manifestation of those holy dawns and ancient rises. Even though these eternal beings seemingly emerge from the wombs of earthly mothers, in reality, they descend from the heavens of command. Even though they dwell on earth, they lean on the fluttering of meanings. Even though they walk among people, they fly in the atmospheres of closeness. Without physically moving, their spirits stroll. Without wings, they fly towards the ascents of unity.

In every breath, they traverse the east and the west of creation and in every moment, they roam through the kingdoms of unseen and seen. They stand on the throne of "No affair distracts Him from another affair" and reside on the seat of "Every day He is in some affair." They are dispatched from the heights of the power of the Eternal Sovereign and the loftiness of the will of the Supreme King. This is what is meant by His saying: "descending from the sky."

##### Heaven {#sec-heaven}

75 The term "heaven" is applied in the discourses of the Suns of Meanings at many levels, such as the heaven of command, the heaven of will, the heaven of desire, the heaven of gnosis, the heaven of certainty, the heaven of explanation, the heaven of appearance, the heaven of inner realities, and the like. In each instance of the use of the term "heaven," it signifies a meaning that is inaccessible to anyone other than those who are acquainted with the mysteries of unity and those who drink from the cups of eternity.

For example, it is stated: "And in the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised," even though sustenance sprouts from the earth. Similarly, "The names descend from the sky," while the names appear from the tongues of servants.

If you purify the mirror of your heart from the dust of worldly desires, you will perceive all the implied meanings of the Words in each appearance, and you will become aware of the secrets of knowledge. However, until you burn away the veils of conventional knowledge, which is common among servants, with the fire of detachment, you will not attain the dawn of the light of true knowledge.

76 Knowledge is divided into two types: divine knowledge and satanic knowledge. The former arises from the inspirations of the true Sovereign, while the latter emerges from the imaginations of dark souls. The teacher of the former is the Creator Himself, while the instructor of the latter is the whisperings of carnal desires. The divine knowledge is described as: "Be conscious of Allah, and Allah will teach you," whereas the satanic knowledge is described as: "Knowledge is the greatest veil."

The fruits of the tree of divine knowledge are patience, longing, gnosis, and love, while the fruits of the tree of satanic knowledge are arrogance, vanity, and pride. None of the scent of these dark sciences, which have overshadowed all lands, can be smelled in the discourses of those who speak in the language of knowledge.

This satanic tree brings forth nothing but transgression and obscenity, it grants nothing but rancor and animosity. Its fruit is a deadly poison, and its shade is a destructive fire.

The speaker indeed speaks truth when he says:

> *"Grasp the tails of desires and cast off modesty,*
>
> *Abandon the path of the devout, even if they are noble."*

77 So, one must purify the heart from all that has been heard and sanctify the soul from all attachments, so that it becomes a place capable of perceiving divine inspirations and a treasury of the secrets of divine knowledge. As it is said, "The seeker on the bright path and the red pillar will not reach the status of his homeland except by letting go of what is in the hands of people." This is a condition for the seeker. Reflect and contemplate correctly so that you may stand without any veil before the purpose of the Book.

78 Indeed, we have strayed far from the topic, although everything we've mentioned is part of it. I swear by God, while I aim to be concise and provide the least necessary, I see that the reins of the pen have slipped from my hand. Despite this, there are countless unsung nights remaining hidden in the shell of the heart, and there are numerous hidden meanings hidden in the chambers of wisdom that no one has touched, "Untouched before them by man or jinn."

Despite all these explanations, it seems as if not a single word about the intended purpose has been mentioned and not a single hint about the desired subject has come up. Until when will a confidant be found who will adhere to the sanctity of the beloved's sanctuary, who will reach the intended Kaaba, and without ears and tongue, will hear and understand the secrets of expression?

##### Clouds {#sec-clouds}

79 So, from these firm and clear statements, the intended meaning of the "sky" in the revealed verse became clear and understood. And when it is said: "He descends with the clouds", the intended meaning of "clouds" refers to those matters which are contrary to the desires and wishes of people. This is as mentioned in the said verse: "So whenever a messenger came to you with something your souls did not desire, you became arrogant, and so a group of them you denied, and another group you kill."

For example, changes in laws, alterations in religious rulings, lifting traditional rules and customs, the advancement of believers from the masses over the deniers among scholars, and the manifestation of that eternal beauty within human limitations like eating, drinking, poverty, wealth, honor, humiliation, sleep, and wakefulness, and the like. These are things that throw people into doubt and prevent them. All these barriers are metaphorically referred to as "clouds".

80 And this is the cloud that splits and tears open the skies of knowledge and wisdom for all who are on earth, as it says: "On the day the sky will split open with clouds." And just as clouds prevent people's eyes from observing the physical sun, likewise, these mentioned affairs prevent people from perceiving that true Sun. This is mentioned in the Book from the language of the disbelievers: "And they say, 'Why does this messenger eat food and walk in the markets? Why was not an angel sent down to him, to be a warner with him?'"

Examples of this are the apparent poverty of the prophets, apparent trials, and the physical necessities of the body like hunger, sickness, and possible accidents. When these conditions appeared from those holy bodies, people were left bewildered in the deserts of doubt and suspicion, and the wilderness of illusion and confusion. They wondered how a soul could come from God and show dominion over all who are on earth and attribute the reason for the creation of the universe to itself, as it has said: "If it were not for you, I would not have created the orbits." And yet, it is subjected to these minor affairs?

As they have heard about each prophet's trials and his companions from poverty, disease, and humiliation, such as sending their heads as gifts in cities, preventing them from what they were commanded, and each one was afflicted at the hands of the enemies of the religion to the extent that they did to them what they wanted.

81 It is understood that the changes and transformations that occur in each manifestation are the dark clouds that obstruct the vision of the knowledge of the servants from recognizing that divine Sun, which shines from the east of its essence. For years, servants have remained in the imitation of their forefathers, and they have been brought up in the manners and ways that have been established in that religion.

Once they hear or observe someone who has been among them and is identical to them in all human boundaries, and yet, he removes all those religious boundaries that they have been brought up with for successive centuries, and those who deny and oppose it are considered infidels, sinners, and immoral, these are certainly veils and clouds for those whose hearts have not drunk from the fountain of detachment and have not sipped from the Kawthar of recognition.

Upon simply hearing these matters, they become so veiled from perceiving that Sun that they immediately judge his disbelief without question or answer and issue a fatwa for his murder, as they have seen and heard from the earlier generations, and it has also been observed in this time.

82 Thus, one must strive so that, with divine assistance, we are not prevented by these dark veils and divine tests from observing that radiant beauty, and that we recognize Him for who He is. If we seek evidence, we should be content with a single argument and proof, so that we may attain the source of infinite grace, where all other graces are insignificant in comparison. We should not indulge in daily objections based on illusions or cling to unfounded beliefs.

83 SubhanAllah, despite the fact that these matters have been hinted at in peculiar ways and indicated by strange signs so that everyone can be informed and not deprive themselves of the ocean of divine graces on that day, it still occurs as it is observed. These themes are also revealed in the Quran as it says: "Do they then wait for anything other than that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds...". However, some scholars of the apparent have misunderstood this verse as one of the signs of the Day of Judgment, which they themselves have rationalized.

The content of the verse is as follows: Are they waiting for nothing else but that Allah should come to them in the shade of the clouds? This theme is mentioned in most of the divine books and in all places where the signs of the appearance are mentioned, as previously stated.

84 Also, the Quran says: "On the Day the sky will produce a visible smoke, covering the people, this will be a painful torment." The content of this verse is as follows: A day will come when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke that will envelop the people, and this will be a painful torment. These matters, which go against the evil desires and contrary to the whims of the people, are used by the Almighty Lord as a measure and test for His servants. It separates the fortunate from the unfortunate, the one who turns away from the one who turns towards Him, as mentioned before. The variations, abrogations, and destruction of traditional customs and the elimination of defined boundaries are referred to as "smoke" in the aforementioned verse.

And what smoke is greater than this smoke that has enveloped all people and is a torment for them, as they are unable to remove it despite their attempts? And they are tortured with a new torment at every moment by the fire of their own selves. For every time they hear that this divine decree and firm command of the Eternal is manifesting itself across the earth and is rising every day, a new fire is kindled in their hearts. And what they observe of the power, determination, and steadfastness of these people of truth who grow stronger and more deeply rooted each day through divine grace, gives rise to new anxieties in their souls.

During these days, praise be to Allah, the divine power has so prevailed that they do not dare to speak, and if they encounter one of the people of truth who would willingly sacrifice a hundred thousand lives in the path of the Beloved, they would profess faith out of fear, and when they are alone, they engage in cursing and reviling. As the Quran says, "When they meet you, they say, 'We believe.' But when they are alone, they bite their fingertips in rage against you. Say, 'Die in your rage. Allah is fully aware of what is in the hearts.'"

85 It is near at hand that you will witness the proclamation of divine power raised in all lands, and observe the evident signs of His domination and sovereignty in every region. Indeed, most scholars have not grasped these verses and have not understood the true meaning of the Resurrection; therefore, they interpret everything through the lens of an assumed afterlife, without being fully aware.

The One God is witness that if there is even a little insight, one can understand all the intended meanings just through the subtle hints in these two verses and, with the grace of the Merciful, they will reach the bright dawn of certainty. Just so, may the dove of eternity sing to you upon the branches of the Lote-Tree of Glory, that you may travel in the paths of knowledge and wisdom by the permission of Allah.

##### Angels {#sec-angels}

86 In the verse you've quoted, "He sends His angels..." and so forth, the 'angels' in question refer to those souls who, through spiritual power, have burnt away their human attributes in the fire of Divine love and have embodied the exalted and cherubic traits. As Imam Sadiq says in describing the cherubim: "There are some among our followers who are behind the Divine Throne."

While the phrase 'behind the Throne' has many intended meanings, both exoteric and esoteric, in one context, it signifies the absence of true followers (Shi'a). In another context, he says: "The believer is like red sulfur." Then he asks his listener: "Have you seen red sulfur?" Pay attention to this metaphor, which, being more eloquent than explicit description, implies the non-existence of true believers. This is a saying of that Imam.

Now, observe how many of these unjust people, who have not perceived the fragrance of faith, nonetheless ascribe disbelief to those who, according to the Imam's words, would be considered to possess true faith.

87 Indeed, when these holy beings were purified and sanctified from human afflictions, and adorned with spiritual morals and characterized by holy attributes, they were therefore referred to as angels. Truly, this is the meaning of these words, each section of which has been demonstrated through clear verses, solid evidence, and compelling arguments.

### Corruption of the Scriptures {#sec-corruption-of-the-scriptures}

88 The people of Jesus have not reached these meanings, and since these signs have not appeared in the way that they and their scholars have understood, they have not turned towards the holy manifestations from that Day until now. Consequently, they have been deprived of all the holy effusions and have been veiled from the novelties of the words of the Eternal One. This is the state of these servants on the Day of Resurrection.

They have not realized that if the signs of appearance in each age, as described in the news, appear in the outer world, then who else would be left to deny and turn away? And how could a distinction be made between the fortunate and the unfortunate, the criminal and the pious?

For example, consider, if the expressions written in the Gospel appeared literally, and angels with Jesus son of Mary descended from heaven on a cloud, who else would be worthy of denial, or who would be capable of denial and arrogance? On the contrary, immediately, everyone on earth would be so overwhelmed by a kind of apprehension that they would be unable to speak, let alone reject or accept.

This lack of understanding of these meanings led some Christian scholars to oppose the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). They asked him, "If you are the promised prophet, why aren't the angels with you, which are written in our books to accompany the promised beauty, to support him in his cause, and to warn the servants?" As the Lord of Glory has reported from their tongues, "Why is there not sent down to him an angel to be with him a warner?" which means: "Why isn't an angel sent down with Muhammad to be with him as a warner and a frightener of people?"

89 This has been the case in all eras and epochs, with such objections and differences among people always present. And people have always been preoccupied with verbal adornments, saying that certain signs did not appear, and certain clear proofs did not emerge. And these maladies did not afflict them, but they were clinging to the scholars of the age for confirmation or denial of these abstract jewels and divine structures. And these scholars, due to their immersion in psychological affairs and preoccupation with ephemeral worldly matters, saw these everlasting suns contrary to their knowledge and understanding and opposed to their efforts and struggles. They interpreted and explained the meanings of divine words, hadiths, and news of divine letters based on their apparent understanding. Therefore, they made themselves and all people despair of the spring of divine grace and mercy, even though they themselves admit and acknowledge the famous hadith that says: "Our speech is difficult, very difficult." And in another place, it says: "Our affair is difficult, very difficult, no one can bear it except a close angel or a sent prophet or a servant whose heart Allah has tested for faith" and it is agreed among themselves that none of these three categories is true for them. The first two categories are clear, but as for the third, they did not survive the divine trials, and in the manifestation of the divine criterion, nothing other than deception came from them.

90 Glory be to God! Despite acknowledging this hadith, how can scholars, who are still in doubt and suspicion about jurisprudential issues, claim knowledge of the mysteries of divine principles and the jewels of the secrets of holy words? They say that such and such hadith, which is among the signs of the appearance of the Qa'im, has not yet appeared, even though they have never understood the essence of the meanings of the hadiths. They are oblivious to the fact that all signs have appeared, the path of the affair has been drawn, and the believers pass by it like lightning, and they are waiting for the appearance of the sign. Say, "O assembly of the ignorant, wait as those before you from the waiters waited."

91 Indeed, if they are asked about the conditions for the appearance of the prophets after the ones mentioned in the previous books, including the signs of their emergence and the rise of the Mohammadan sun, as mentioned, none of which have visibly appeared, why then do you reject Christians and the like and rule on their disbelief? When they cannot answer, they claim that these books have been distorted and are not from God, while the content of the verses themselves testifies that they are indeed from God. The essence of these verses can also be found in the Quran, if only you could understand. Truthfully, I say that they have not comprehended the meaning of distortion in this period.

92 Yes, indeed, the distortion by the high-ranking and the alteration by the arrogant are mentioned in the revealed verses and the Ahmadi mirror words, but they are mentioned in specific contexts. An example of this is the story of Ibn Suriya at the time when the people of Khaybar asked about the punishment for an adulterous married man and woman. The Prophet declared the divine law to be stoning. They denied that there was such a ruling in the Torah. The Prophet asked: "Who among your scholars do you accept and trust his word?" They accepted Ibn Suriya, so the Prophet summoned him and said: "I swear by Allah who parted the sea for you, sent down manna upon you, made the clouds a shade over you, saved you from Pharaoh and his courtiers, and favored you over all people, to tell us what Moses ruled for the punishment of an adulterous married man and woman in the Torah." The meaning of this was that the Prophet swore Ibn Suriya by these firm oaths to reveal what the Torah had decreed as the punishment for adultery by a married person. He said: "O Muhammad, it is stoning." The Prophet asked: "Why then has this law been abrogated among the Jews and is no longer applied?" He said: "When Nebuchadnezzar burned the Temple of Jerusalem and killed all the Jews, none of them remained on earth except a few. The scholars of that era, considering the scarcity of Jews and the abundance of their enemies, gathered in consultation and decided that if they acted according to the law of the Torah, those who survived Nebuchadnezzar would be killed by the law of the book. They decided to completely eliminate the law of capital punishment in this circumstance." During this, Gabriel descended upon the enlightened heart of the Prophet and recited this verse: "They distort words from their \[proper\] usages."

93 This was one context in which distortion was mentioned. And in this case, the meaning of distortion is not as these ignorant ones have understood. Some people claim that the Jewish and Christian scholars erased verses describing the rise of Muhammad from their books and established the opposite. This claim is utterly meaningless and baseless. Is it possible for someone who has faith in a book and believes it to be from Allah to erase it? Moreover, the Torah was present all over the earth, not confined to Mecca and Medina that they could alter or change it. But the meaning of distortion is exactly what all the scholars of the divine law are engaged in today: interpreting and giving meaning to the book according to their own desires and whims. As in the time of the Prophet, when the Jews interpreted the verses of the Torah that were a model for the Prophet's advent according to their desires and were not satisfied with his explanation, the ruling of distortion was issued against them. It's evident today how the followers of the divine law distort the verses of the book related to the signs of the advent, interpreting them according to their whims and desires, as can be seen.

94 In another place, it says: "And indeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, 'This is from Allah,' but it is not from Allah. And they speak untruth about Allah while they know." This verse is also an example of the distortion of the meanings of divine words, not the erasure of literal words, as can be understood from the verse. And this is also understood by upright minds.

95 In another place, it says: "So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, then say, 'This is from Allah,' in order to exchange it for a small price." Until the end of the verse. This verse was revealed about the Jewish scholars and their elders who, to please the wealthy, attract worldly adornments, and express their disbelief, wrote several tablets to refute the Prophet and justified their claims with various proofs which are not permissible to mention, attributing their justifications to the books of the Torah.

96 As can be observed today, ignorant scholars of the present age have written a great deal in rejection of this novel matter, assuming that these fabrications are in accordance with the verses of the Book and in line with the words of the wise.

97 Indeed, the purpose of these reminders is that if they say the mentioned signs from the Gospel have been corrupted and reject them, holding onto their verses and reports, know that it is utter falsehood and pure fabrication. Yes, the mention of corruption is in the sense that it has been mentioned in specific places, some of which we have mentioned, so it becomes clear and proven to every observer that even the knowledge of the apparent sciences is with some of the divine illiterate ones. Thus, opponents should no longer fall into this illusion and object that such and such a verse is proof of corruption, and these people have mentioned these grades and topics out of lack of knowledge. And moreover, most of the verses that are signs of corruption have been revealed about the Jews, if you are searching in the islands of the knowledge of distinction.

98 Although some foolish people on earth have said that the celestial Gospel is no longer in the hands of Christians and has ascended to heaven, they are oblivious to the fact that by this statement, they affirm the utmost injustice and oppression for the Almighty Creator. This is because after the sun of the beauty of Jesus was absent from his people and ascended to the fourth heaven, the Book of Truth, which is his greatest evidence among his creations, also became absent. Then, to what were these people adhering from the time of Jesus until the emergence of the sun of Muhammad? And to what were they commanded? And then, how do they become subject to the vengeance of the true Avenger, and become the place for the descent of punishment and the whip of the spiritual king?

Apart from all this, it would mean that the bounty of the Giver is cut off and the door of mercy of the King of creation is closed. So we seek refuge in God from what the servants presume about Him, for He is exalted above what they know.

99 O Beloved, in this eternal dawn, where the lights of "Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth" envelop the universe, and the pavilion of infallibility and protection of "And Allah refuses but to perfect His light" is elevated, and the hand of power "in whose hand is the dominion of all things" is extended and established. We should firmly gird up the loins of our resolve, that perhaps by the grace and generosity of the Divine, we may enter into the holy city of "Indeed we belong to Allah", so that we may find residence in the stations of glory "to Him we shall return".

God willing, we must cleanse the eye of the heart from the hints of water and clay so that you may perceive the limitless stages of gnosis and see the truth clearer than that which you need evidence to establish its existence or seek an argument to cling to.

100 O seeker of love, if in the breeze of the spirit you see the Bird of Truth manifest above all else to the extent that you find nothing other than Him. "He was Allah, and there was nothing with Him." And this sacred station is not one that can be deduced by any evidence or can appear by any proof. And if in the space of ultimate sanctity, all things are known by His familiarity and He is known by Himself and will always be known.

And if you dwell in the land of reasoning, suffice it to what He Himself has stated: "Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book?" This is the argument that He Himself has established, and there is no argument greater than this: "His signs are His proof, and His existence is His affirmation."

101 At this time, I invoke the people of eloquence, mystics, philosophers, scholars, and martyrs to not forget the divine commands that are mentioned in the Book, and to always be observant of the essence of the matter, so that they may not cling to some phrases of the Book when the essence of essences, the truth of truths, and the light of lights appear, attributing to Him what has come down in the Quran.

Verily, that sovereign of identity is capable of taking away the life of all expression and creation with a single word of His wondrous speech or to grant eternal unique life to all with a single word and resurrect them from the graves of self and desire. Be vigilant and observant, for all ends in faith in Him and realization of His days and meeting with Him.

"Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but \[true\] righteousness is \[in\] one who believes in Allah and the Last Day."

Listen, O people of eloquence, what We have enjoined upon you by truth, perhaps you will dwell under a shadow that was extended in the days of God.

## Part Two: The Sovereignty of the Manifestations of God

### Mirrors of the Essence of God {#sec-mirrors-of-essence-of-god}

102 The aforementioned Gate in the statement that the Sun of Truth and the Manifestation of the Essence of God will indeed be a sovereign over all who are in the heavens and the earth, even if not a single one of the inhabitants of the earth obeys Him, and independent of everyone in the kingdom, even if He has not a dinar. Thus do We reveal to you the secrets of the matter and cast upon you the jewels of wisdom so that you may indeed fly with the wings of detachment in the air that was hidden from the sights.

103 The subtleties and gems of this gate are meant to become evident and clear to those possessing pure souls and sanctified mirrors. This is to show that the Suns of Truth and the Mirrors of Unity, in every age and time when they emerge from the tent of identity into the realm of witnessing, do so with a conquering sovereignty and a dominant authority for the edification of possibilities and the bestowal of grace upon all beings. Indeed, this hidden gem and concealed treasure is the locus of the manifestation of "God does what He wills and decrees what He desires."

104 It is clear to those with knowledge and enlightened hearts that the unseen Identity and the sanctified Essence of Unity have always been, and will always remain, exalted and beyond emergence, manifestation, ascent, descent, ingress, and egress. He is above the descriptions of any describer and the perceptions of any perceiver. He has always been hidden in His essence and will always remain veiled from all sights and observations in His existence. "Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives \[all\] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted." There is no possible relationship, connection, disjunction, union, proximity, distance, direction, or reference between Him and anything that could possibly exist, for everything in the heavens and the earth came into existence by His command and stepped into the realm of existence and being from sheer non-existence by His Will, which is the Breath of His Command.

105 Glorified be God! In fact, there is no relation or connection even between the possible beings and His Word. "And Allah cautions you (to remember) His (own) Self" is a clear proof of this point, and "He was Allah, and there was nothing with Him" is a manifest evidence. Thus, all prophets, successors, scholars, mystics, and wise individuals have admitted and accepted their inability to comprehend the essence of that Gem of gems, and their impotence to understand and reach that Reality of realities.

106 And when the doors of understanding the essence of the Pre-eternal were closed to the realm of possible beings, thus, in accordance with His boundless mercy - "His mercy encompasses everything" - He manifested luminous and holy gems from the spiritual realms in the form of noble human bodies among the creation, to recount the tales of that Pre-eternal Essence and the Eternal Entity. These holy mirrors and reflections all recount from that Sun of Existence and Desired Essence; for instance, their knowledge is from His Knowledge, their power is from His Power, their sovereignty is from His Sovereignty, their beauty is from His Beauty, and their manifestation is from His Manifestation. They are the repositories of divine sciences, the locales of the Unseen Wisdom, the manifestations of the infinite effusion, and the mirrors reflecting the Everlasting Sun, as He says: "There is no difference between You and them except that they are Your servants and Your creation". And this is the station of "I am He and He is I" that is mentioned in the hadith.

#### The Potentials of All Humans {#sec-the-potentials-of-all-humans}

107 And there are numerous traditions and narrations proving this point, which I have not mentioned for the sake of brevity. Indeed, all that is in the heavens and the earth are venues for the manifestation of divine attributes and names. As in each atom, the effects of the manifestation of that True Sun are clear and visible, as if without its manifestation in the physical world, nothing would be honored with the robe of existence or endowed with being. Consider the suns of knowledge that are concealed in an atom, and the oceans of wisdom that are hidden in a droplet.

Especially human beings, among all creatures, have been distinguished with this garment and honored with this nobility. Indeed, all divine names and attributes are manifested in human beings in the most perfect and noblest way, and all these names and attributes relate to them. This is why it is said, "Man is My mystery, and I am his mystery." And numerous verses that subtly and delicately allude to this exquisite point are recorded and mentioned in all heavenly books and divine scriptures. As He says: "We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves." And in another place He says: "And in yourselves, then will you not see?" And in another place He says: "And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget their own selves." As the Sultan of eternity, may my soul be sacrificed for him in the pavilion of the unseen, says: "He who knows himself knows his Lord."

108 I swear by God, my esteemed one, if you reflect a little on these statements, you will find the doors of divine wisdom and the portals of infinite knowledge opening before you.

109 Indeed, from these statements it becomes clear that all things speak of the divine Names and Attributes. Each one, according to its capacity, testifies and gives evidence to divine knowledge, to the extent that it encompasses the manifestations of attributive and nominal realities across all unseen and seen realms.

As it has been said: "Can there be for anyone other than You from the manifestations what is not for You, until He becomes the Manifest for you. Blind is the eye that does not see You." And again, the Sultan of eternity says: "I have not seen anything except that I have seen God in it, before it, or after it." And in the narration of Kumayl, it says: "A light shone from the dawn of eternity and its traces appear on the bodies of Unity."

And human beings, who are the most noble and perfect of creatures, give the strongest indication and greatest tale of all known things, and the most perfect and superior among humans are the manifestations of the sun of Truth. In fact, everything else that exists does so by their will and is set in motion by their bounty. "Were it not for you, I would not have created the orbits." Indeed, everything in their holy presence is utterly non-existent and completely lost.

Their mention is exalted above that of others, and their description is sanctified above the description of anyone else. These holy embodiments are the primeval mirrors of eternity, which have told of the unseen of all unseen, and of all His Names and Attributes - from knowledge and power to sovereignty, greatness, mercy, wisdom, dignity, generosity, and kindness. All these Attributes are manifest and apparent from the appearance of this Jewel of Unity.

#### Apparent and Non-Apparent Attributes

110 These attributes are not exclusively for some, without others. Rather, all the close prophets and holy saints are described with these attributes and named with these names. The end of some in some ranks appear more manifestly and brighter. As it says: "Those are the messengers; We have favored some of them over others."

Therefore, it is clear and certain that the place of appearance and emergence of all these lofty attributes and infinite names are His prophets and His saints, whether some of these attributes appear apparently in those luminous structures or not. It is not the case that if an attribute does not appear apparently from those detached spirits, that attribute would be negated from those potential divine attributes and mines of divine names.

Therefore, the rule of all the attributes of God, such as sovereignty, greatness, and the like, applies to all these enlightened existences and unique emergences, even though they may not appear apparently in sovereignty and the like. This paragraph is established and verified for anyone with insight, no further proof is needed.

111 Indeed, these servants, having not drawn from the clear and enlightened springs of divine knowledge, the explanations of the holy words, thus wander thirsty and desolate in the valley of conjectures and heedlessness, and being averse to the sweet river of abundance, revolve in the salt whirlpool. As it is described about them in the divine verse: "And if they see the way of righteousness, they do not adopt it as a way; and if they see the way of error, they adopt it as a way. That is because they have denied Our signs and were heedless of them."

The translation of which is: If they see the way of righteousness and salvation, they do not adopt it and do not turn towards it. But if they see the path of falsehood, rebellion, and misguidance, they consider it their path to truth. This inclination towards falsehood and turning away from the truth did not manifest, meaning they did not fall into this misguidance and straying, except as a punishment for denying Our signs and being heedless of the revelation and appearances of them.

### Rejection of the Bab

112 As observed in this remarkable and impressive manifestation, millions of divine verses have descended from the heaven of power and mercy. Yet despite this, the majority of creation has turned away and clung to the words of servants who do not comprehend a single one of these verses. This is why they cast doubt on such clear matters and deprive themselves of the divine knowledge and the gardens of everlasting wisdom. It is a tragic situation where the abundance of divine guidance is rejected in favor of limited human understanding, leading to ignorance and deprivation from divine wisdom.

#### The Bab's Sovereignty {#sec-the-babs-sovereignty}

113 Indeed, returning to the subject that was asked about, that the sovereignty of the Qa'im, although it has been narrated in traditions from luminous stars, no sign of manifest sovereignty has appeared, rather the opposite has come to pass. His followers and allies are and have been afflicted and besieged by people, and are in the utmost state of humiliation and impotence in the temporal realm. However, the sovereignty mentioned in the scriptures for the Qa'im is a certainty, beyond a doubt, but it is not the kind of sovereignty and rule that everyone can comprehend. Also, all previous prophets who have given the good tidings to the people about the upcoming manifestation, have all referred to this aspect of sovereignty of the future manifestation, as recorded in the previous scriptures. This is not specific to the Qa'im; rather, for all previous and subsequent manifestations, the establishment of sovereignty and all the attributes and names are affirmed and confirmed, as they are manifestations of unseen attributes and studies of divine secrets, as mentioned earlier.

114 And another point is that the sovereignty in question is His Holiness's encompassing power and authority over all possible things, whether it manifests in the physical world as overt rule or not. This is subject to His Holiness's own will and discretion. However, it is well known that the sovereignty, wealth, life, death, resurrection, and recompense mentioned in earlier texts do not refer to what people nowadays understand and perceive. Instead, the sovereignty referred to is a kind of sovereignty that becomes apparent on its own, for its own sake, during the days of the manifestation of each of the suns of truth. It is a kind of internal encompassment that encompasses all who are in the heavens and the earth, and then it appears in the physical world according to the capacity of existence, time, and creation, as can be seen in the current apparent and manifest rule of the Holy Messenger among the people. And at first, the state of His Holiness was as you have heard. Consider how much the infidels and the misguided - who were the scholars of that era and their associates - imposed upon that innate nature and naive clay. Think of how much rubble and thorns they scattered on the path of His Holiness. And it is clear that these individuals, with their wicked, satanic suspicions, thought that by causing harm to that eternal edifice they were paving the way for their own salvation, because all the scholars of the era, like Abdullah Ubay, Abu Amir the Monk, Ka'b ibn Ashraf, and Nadir ibn Harith, all denied His Holiness, accusing him of madness and slandering him, and attributing to him things that God forbid should ever be recorded by a pen or carried on tablets. Indeed, these false accusations caused people to harm His Holiness. It is clear and evident that if the scholars of the time reject and discard someone, and do not consider them a believer, what befalls that person is what happened and was seen with this servant.

#### Challenges the Prophet Muhammad Faced

115 This is where His Holiness said: "No prophet has been harmed as much as I have been harmed." The allegations and abuses that were made against His Holiness are all mentioned in the criterion (Quran). So turn to it, perhaps you can gain insights into the situation. It even reached a point where it was very hard on His Holiness that nobody was interacting with him and his companions for a while and anyone who came to serve His Holiness caused him the utmost harm.

116 At this time, I mention a verse which if you open your insightful eye, you would lament and mourn for the oppression of that Holy Personage for as long as you live. The verse was revealed at a time when that Holy Personage, due to the severity of afflictions and the people's aversion, was utterly depressed and desolate. Gabriel descended from the lote tree of the utmost boundary and recited this verse: "And if their aversion is hard on you, then if you can seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the sky." The translation is that if the aversion of the averters is heavy upon you and the turning away of the hypocrites and their harm is difficult for you, then if you can, seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the sky, implying that there is no solution and they will not let you be unless you hide underground or flee to the sky.

117 Observe today how many of the sultans pay homage to His name, how many territories and people living under His shadow take pride in their association with Him, mentioning this blessed name with utmost respect and reverence on pulpits and platforms. Even the sultans who have not entered under His shadow and have not renounced their cloak of disbelief also acknowledge the greatness and majesty of this sun of grace. This is the apparent sovereignty that you observe. Undoubtedly, this is the case for all prophets, whether during their lifetime or after their ascension, they become manifest and established in the true abode as observed today. But the sovereignty that is intended does not cease to revolve around them, is always with them, and does not find any separation. This is the inner sovereignty that encompasses everything in the heavens and the earth.

118 Part of that sovereignty manifested from that Sun of Oneness. Haven't you heard how it distinguished between light and darkness, the fortunate and the unfortunate, the believer and the disbeliever with just one verse? All the signs and indications of resurrection, including the gathering, resurrection, accountability, book-keeping, and more, were made clear and brought to the arena of witnessing with the revelation of that single verse. Also, that revealed verse was mercy for the righteous, meaning those souls who said "We hear and obey" while listening, and it became a punishment for the wicked, meaning those who said "We hear and disobey" after listening. It served as the Sword of God to distinguish believers from disbelievers and fathers from sons. As you have seen, those who acknowledged and those who denied were willing to risk their lives and wealth. How many fathers turned away from their sons, and how many lovers sought protection from their beloved ones. This wondrous sword was so sharp and decisive that it severed all relationships. From one perspective, observe how it united. As it was observed, a group of people, who for years had the seeds of resentment and hostility sowed among them by the satan of self, became so united and agreed due to faith in this unique and resolute Cause that it seemed they emerged from a single lineage. In this way, God unites the hearts of those who have turned to Him and believed in His verses, and they were among those who drank from the abundance of His grace with the hands of might. Moreover, observe how many people of various beliefs, sects, and dispositions have worn the new garment of oneness from this divine breeze of goodwill and this spiritual garden and have drunk from the cup of singularity.

119 This is the meaning of the well-known Hadith which states that the wolf and the sheep will eat and drink from the same place. Now, look at the lack of understanding of these ignorant ones, like the previous nations, who are still waiting for when these animals will gather on a single dining spread. This is the state of people. It's as if they have never drunk from the cup of fairness and have never taken a step on the path of justice. Apart from all this, how beautifully does the occurrence of this matter manifest in the world of creation? What a blessing it is that what has been revealed about their condition: "They have hearts with which they do not understand, and they have eyes with which they do not see."

120 Also, observe how the account of creatures was drawn out by the revelation of just this one verse from the heaven of the divine will. Whoever confessed and sought favor, his good deeds exceeded his bad deeds, and all his sins were forgiven and pardoned. This confirms the divine attribute that He is swift in taking account, and it's how God changes bad deeds into good ones if you could discern the horizons of knowledge and scales of wisdom.

Similarly, whoever partook from the cup of divine love received from the ocean of everlasting blessings and the clouds of eternal mercy, and gained everlasting spiritual life. And every soul that did not accept suffered from eternal death. The meaning of death and life mentioned in the scriptures refers to spiritual death and life.

It is due to the lack of understanding of this meaning that the majority of people objected in every divine manifestation, did not find guidance from the sun of guidance, and did not follow the eternal beauty.

121 Just as when the Muhammadan lamp was ignited in the niche of Ahmad's \[Muhammad's\] prophecy, the command of resurrection, assembly, life, and death was declared to the people. This led to a rise in opposition and the doors of mockery were thrown open. As has been reported from the mouth of the pagans by the Trustworthy Spirit (Gabriel): "And if thou say, 'You will indeed be resurrected after death,' those who disbelieve will surely say, 'This is nothing but obvious magic'." (Quran 10:45)

The essence of this is that if you say to these pagans that you are resurrected after dying, undoubtedly those who have disbelieved in God and His signs will say, 'This is nothing but clear and obvious magic.' In another place, it says: "And if you are astonished, then astonishing is their saying: 'When we are dust, will we indeed be \[created\] in a new creation?'" (Quran 13:5)

This means that if you are amazed, then amazing is the statement of the disbelievers and those who turn away. They said, out of mockery: "Were we dust? Are we the ones to be resurrected?" Thus, in another place, He angrily says to them: "Do we then weary with the first creation? But they are in confusion over a new creation." (Quran 50:15)

The essence of this is: Are we incapable or weary of the first creation? Rather, these pagans are in doubt and confusion about a new creation.

122 The exegetes and the people of the literal interpretation, not understanding the meanings of divine words and being veiled from the main purpose, thus justified their interpretation based on grammatical rules, such as "اذا" (when/if), which, when placed at the beginning of a past tense verb, conveys a future meaning. Then, they became perplexed in cases where the word "اذا" was not used, such as the verse: "And the Trumpet will be blown; that will be the Day whereof Warning had been given. And every person will come forth along with an (angel) to drive (him), and an (angel) to bear witness." The apparent meaning of which is: a blast was sounded on the Trumpet, and that is the Day of Threat which seemed far off to the views, and every soul came for reckoning, and with each is a driver and a witness.

In such instances, either they considered the word "اذا" as implicit, or they reasoned that since the Resurrection is certain to occur, it is conveyed in the past tense as though it had already happened. See how lacking in perception and discernment they are. They do not comprehend the Muhammadan blast, which is explicitly mentioned, and they deprive themselves of the outpourings of this divine silver, waiting instead for the Trumpet of Israfil who is one of His servants, even though the existence of Israfil and the likes of him has been affirmed by His Holiness Himself.

Say, do you prefer to replace that which is better for you with that which is worse? What a terrible replacement you've chosen in place of the truth! You were a people who were evil and lost.
